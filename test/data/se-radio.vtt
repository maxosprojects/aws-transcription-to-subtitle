shines at the university of nevada las
vegas andreas has been working on

9 
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.000
creating technologies that make it
easier for people including those with

10 
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.000
disabilities to write computer software
he helped establish the first national

11 
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.000
educational infrastructure for blind or
visually impaired students to learn

12 
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.000

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.000
shines education welcome to the show
under yes thanks and thanks for

16 
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.000
inviting me so this show is about how
blind and visually impaired people

17 
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.000
interact with sulfur but first let's
start with the basics how many blind or

18 
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.000
visually impaired people are there in
the world what should we

19 
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.000
take into account when designing so far
for them it's about one point three

20 
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.000
million people ball park and one

21 
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.000
in the us and that's a lot of people
it's enough to at least make a dent on

22 
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.000
any kind of mark to market you could
sell for

23 
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.000
so help us understand how blind people
using computer because most people that

24 
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.000
listen to the show probably are sighted
outside it is how we call people like

25 
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.000
that khun c

26 
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and they're used to using the mouse
looking at the screen what do blind and

27 
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.000
visually

28 
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.000
officially empower people do

29 
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.000
there's a variety of things that they
do

30 
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.000
many people that are blind or visually
impaired have partial vision or

31 
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.000
sometimes called functional vision
depending on what it is

32 
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.000
and usually that means they can see
some things or they can see color or

33 
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.000
they can see some amount of light
depending upon the person.

34 
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.000
So in those cases you might use
technologies like screen magnifier zor

35 
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.000
you might use literally a magnifying
glass for other types of things

36 
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.000
if you are non sighted meaning you have
no sight at all or you have no vision

37 
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.000
that's effectively functional than a
more typical devices either braille or

38 
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.000
a screen reader probably the most
common is screen reader technologies

39 
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.000
and basically what it means is that the
computer translates what's on the

40 
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.000
screen into speech

41 
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.000
can you give us a nim precious in for
how that would look like so if if a

42 
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.000
screen reader listens to or looks at
the web page how does that some slash

43 
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.000
luke

44 
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.000
yeah, i'll turn it on

45 
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.000
a v h agencies receiving federal
qualifies fiscal year two thousand

46 
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.000
sixteen lead content you are currently
on web content to enter the wet area

47 
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.000
press control option shift down arrow
that particular screenwriters called

48 
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.000
voiceover it's the screening option
happens to be on mac on windows there's

49 
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.000
a bunch of them there's one called
nvidia, which is free there's one

50 
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.000
that's made by a company called freedom
scientific called jaws pretty popular

51 
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.000
but quite quite expensive and windows
has one built in a cz well that's been

52 
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.000
improving over the last few years,

53 
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.000
so when we listen to it it's not only
reading the text on the web site it can

54 
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.000
also navigate the website and give us
information on where you are it said

55 
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.000
something like you are now x yeah
that's good so there's a funny thing so

56 
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.000
academics often talk about this with a
certain term they call it the wear at

57 
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.000
my problem i think the person that
defined that was ah a woman by the name

58 
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.000
of excuse me, joan friend francioni or
frankie and i'm not sure i've never met

59 
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.000
her actually,

60 
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.000
but in any case, the idea is pretty
simple it's that the screen reader ties

61 
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.000
to give you both a sense of the content
and a sense of like where you are on

62 
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.000
the page like the semantics of web page
like i'm in a heading or i'm in a

63 
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.000
paragraph or i'm on a level two heading
stuff like that

64 
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.000
yeah, because not only consuming the
text is a problem navigating is also a

65 
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.000
big problem i've understood right? Yeah

66 
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.000
yes, the navigation parts of it are
probably the most crucial because think

67 
00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:07.000
about it like this if i gave you a long
website and i just read the text

68 
00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:11.000
linearly it would be pretty hard to
understand because won't be very long

69 
00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:15.000
and if you can navigate a web page,
then you khun selectively determine

70 
00:04:15.582 --> 00:04:17.000
what information toe understand when

71 
00:04:18.082 --> 00:04:21.000
and that makes it a lot easier. So so
far we thought about websites and

72 
00:04:21.892 --> 00:04:27.000
navigation but of course there's also
acts and programs do they also work

73 
00:04:27.152 --> 00:04:28.000
with build in screen reader? Are you

74 
00:04:29.142 --> 00:04:31.000
ap and program developers have to do
something special?

75 
00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:36.000
It's complicated unfortunately so on
the webs on the web there's

76 
00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:41.000
a number of rather excellent standards
for accessibility in part just because

77 
00:04:41.522 --> 00:04:47.000
the webs used a lot s o to give your
listeners on example one is called aria

78 
00:04:47.372 --> 00:04:50.000
aria is basically a way that you could
do interactive web sites is sort of

79 
00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:54.000
the type of thing if you wanted like an
interactive facebook or something to be

80 
00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:59.000
blind, accessible apse khun definitely
be accessible as well, but how they're

81 
00:04:59.612 --> 00:05:03.000
accessible varies by platform and is
actually one of the sort of pain points.

82 
00:05:03.832 --> 00:05:04.000
For example,

83 
00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:09.000
if i want to make my app from apple
accessible there's certain happily type

84 
00:05:09.982 --> 00:05:12.000
things that i have to do and they're
kind of tricky

85 
00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:17.000
and android has its own platform with
its own languages and ecosystem on top

86 
00:05:17.822 --> 00:05:22.000
of that, if you're using apse on
something like a tablet or phone they

87 
00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:25.000
have different screen reader
technologies so apple has voice over

88 
00:05:25.982 --> 00:05:29.000
which i think most people credit a
scholar named sean kane for inventing

89 
00:05:29.882 --> 00:05:34.000
sort of like really cool gestures that
you use specifically for blind

90 
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:34.000
individuals

91 
00:05:35.062 --> 00:05:39.000
on dh android sort of has those too but
they kind of have weird variations and

92 
00:05:39.412 --> 00:05:43.000
are complicated can we talk for a
living more about voiceover on the

93 
00:05:43.112 --> 00:05:47.000
iphone because i've seen in an action
but i think our audience might be a

94 
00:05:47.232 --> 00:05:51.000
little bit confused how does that work
with because the on ly interface is the

95 
00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:55.000
scream any aikens how does that work
and how does it work with special

96 
00:05:55.512 --> 00:06:02.000
gestures? Okay, so how to describe it
in words so think about it like this

97 
00:06:02.852 --> 00:06:08.000
like if i want to if i'ma sided user
and i'm scrolling wrong along i might

98 
00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:12.000
move my finger up and down and that
would let me see the content but if i'm

99 
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:17.000
blind oftentimes what i do is i might
tap or tap on parts of the screen or

100 
00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:22.000
double tap to interact with it and when
i do that if i hit a target it'll talk

101 
00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:27.000
so the idea is that i can use gestures
to sort of interact semantically with

102 
00:06:27.752 --> 00:06:32.000
the tablet as opposed to just scrolling
with a finger and reading it so it

103 
00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:36.000
would read for example, the name of the
aps and then if i hear the ad buy wants,

104 
00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:40.000
i would step and then it would open
that yeah, stuff like that so like my

105 
00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:45.000
friend, what a friend of mine that does
uber all the time on his iphone taps it

106 
00:06:45.002 --> 00:06:47.000
in a certain way and i will give him a
sense of where it is on the map and

107 
00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:51.000
things like that you could actually use
a lot of absent so long as the

108 
00:06:51.262 --> 00:06:52.000
developer codes it in

109 
00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:58.000
so let's talk about that as long as the
developer codes it in a little bit. So

110 
00:06:58.622 --> 00:07:04.000
how well are we doing at this point?
Are most aps operating systems and

111 
00:07:04.522 --> 00:07:09.000
websites accessible? Our day notes are
gay medium assessable how how well

112 
00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:09.000
we're doing,

113 
00:07:10.312 --> 00:07:13.000
i don't think i could give you a number
in terms of a percentage, but a feeling

114 
00:07:13.772 --> 00:07:15.000
for me. Yeah, i would say

115 
00:07:16.132 --> 00:07:21.000
that there are some companies that do a
really great job and that those air

116 
00:07:21.662 --> 00:07:25.000
often somewhat bigger ones but that we
have a really long way to go

117 
00:07:26.242 --> 00:07:30.000
and that's not a christmas criticism is
just on observation i mean, oftentimes

118 
00:07:30.572 --> 00:07:33.000
developers don't actually get any
training on building these in school

119 
00:07:33.492 --> 00:07:37.000
and it's not reveal so it's not like
it's not like we have a long way to go

120 
00:07:37.502 --> 00:07:41.000
because the technology's air all bad
for some reason it's just usually don't

121 
00:07:41.492 --> 00:07:45.000
even teach this in school all you know,
developer doesn't learn about thie s

122 
00:07:45.172 --> 00:07:47.000
accessible libraries on mac, which are
the common thing,

123 
00:07:48.142 --> 00:07:52.000
or if you're on desktop platforms,
microsoft has its own libraries, and

124 
00:07:52.852 --> 00:07:56.000
apple has its own libraries, and lennox
has its own libraries, and all of them

125 
00:07:56.982 --> 00:08:01.000
were different, and none of them are
compatible. So personally, i think that

126 
00:08:01.872 --> 00:08:05.000
it would be a lot easier for developers
to develop accessible technology if

127 
00:08:05.182 --> 00:08:08.000
there was, like, a unifying standard
across platforms, but that doesn't

128 
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.000
really exist

129 
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.000
at this stage of the game, at least,
yeah, that was one of my goals in

130 
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.000
inviting you for an episode is to make
developers more aware and to help them

131 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.000
what they can do to make their so far
more accessible, which was also my next

132 
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:27.000
question. So what can we do as the
vespers? What are two things we need to

133 
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.000
think about when wanting to make our
acts more accessible?

134 
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.000
Okay, so the first thing to do if you
design a website is that there's a

135 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:42.000
special set of guidelines from the w
three c, and they are specifically for

136 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.000
accessibility

137 
00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.000
don't make sure we're linked to those
and showed no so people can check them

138 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.000
out. Yeah, and those are affected
easily the most comprehensive source

139 
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.000
about how to make a website accessible,
and they're great. They just tell you

140 
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.000
like, if you have a link,

141 
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.000
how you make that accessible, what kind
of if you have a picture and obviously

142 
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.000
you can't see it, you put in some kind
of all text, right? And there's there's

143 
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.000
all sorts of small things that you can
do there's also some online

144 
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.000
accessibility checkers that you can use
a knight and they're not perfect. You

145 
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.000
know, they can't tell you that your
website is easy to use, but sometimes

146 
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.000
they can at least give you, like, a
check and balance for some of the easy

147 
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.000
thing like, hey, you forgot your all
text for that image. You should go fix

148 
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.000
that stuff like that. You know what?
What are some of the issues? So all

149 
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.000
taxes, i think something people are
familiar with, even if they don't know

150 
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.000
what use it

151 
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.000
you mentioned links what are best
practices for links that are easy to

152 
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.000
fix? Okay, so with links, one thing
that

153 
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.000
is generally good is to not give your
link a moniker that doesn't have

154 
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.000
semantic meaning. So, for example, to
do this, go hear the word here should

155 
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.000
not kill link, because then when you
get it through the

156 
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
screen and it is going to stop, it is
going to say link here. And you're

157 
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.000
going to say wares here,

158 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:01.000
so we'll be better is to say, go to the
website for the block and have that

159 
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.000
whole part b a link, it sounds like a
minor thing, but the screen reader

160 
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.000
could make a difference. You have to
listen to it. Yeah, that that is

161 
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.000
relatively easy to fix because super so
let me understand how exactly that

162 
00:10:11.788 --> 00:10:15.000
we're to screen reader, if you're
navigating, there would be an option to

163 
00:10:15.038 --> 00:10:18.000
go through all the links, and if there
were all labeled here, it will be here,

164 
00:10:18.668 --> 00:10:23.000
here, whereas if you would say the
website of andrea's org website off

165 
00:10:23.778 --> 00:10:28.000
university of nevada as a link, you
could more usually navigate yeah,

166 
00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:30.000
that's the kind of idea, like any time
that you have a structure, give it a

167 
00:10:30.708 --> 00:10:32.000
semantic meaning that's exactly right?
Yeah,

168 
00:10:33.078 --> 00:10:35.000
and the other things that are
relatively easy to fix, that we should

169 
00:10:35.858 --> 00:10:39.000
think, yeah, eso another one that is
kind of an obvious one. I'll tell you,

170 
00:10:39.678 --> 00:10:40.000
when this sort of adorable

171 
00:10:41.028 --> 00:10:45.000
my daughter is, like five, and her
school does a great job, but they have

172 
00:10:45.768 --> 00:10:49.000
a couple accessibility falls on their
website that are just make maybe laugh

173 
00:10:49.848 --> 00:10:51.000
a little bit like they didn't do it
intentionally it's ok,

174 
00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:55.000
and so one thing that they did that
that just i thought was funny is they

175 
00:10:55.538 --> 00:10:59.000
wanted to put a schedule online so what
they did is they took a picture of the

176 
00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:02.000
schedule like a complicated
spreadsheets and then they put that

177 
00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:03.000
onto the website

178 
00:11:04.358 --> 00:11:07.000
and then it shrunk so if you're
visually impaired you can't actually

179 
00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:10.000
read it because the text is to blot it
out and if you have a screen reader

180 
00:11:10.998 --> 00:11:13.000
you're going to get to that thing and
it's going to say image

181 
00:11:14.118 --> 00:11:15.000
so you can't actually do anything so

182 
00:11:16.518 --> 00:11:20.000
one thing to do is don't like replace
content with already accessible things

183 
00:11:20.828 --> 00:11:23.000
you know if you need to have a table,
put a table in there and then give it

184 
00:11:23.798 --> 00:11:28.000
the market that it needs from the w
three c so images to be for making your

185 
00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:33.000
upside nice here but they shouldn't be
replacing consents exactly also have

186 
00:11:33.638 --> 00:11:37.000
bean represented sexually that's
correct that is actual invites

187 
00:11:38.438 --> 00:11:43.000
so what about a user interface if we're
no no longer talking about a website

188 
00:11:43.548 --> 00:11:48.000
but something that has buttons and drop
down menus scroll bars why we do in

189 
00:11:48.388 --> 00:11:51.000
those so that's a little bit trickier
because it depends on the platform and

190 
00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:55.000
it also depends on the a p i that
you're using so for example,

191 
00:11:56.508 --> 00:12:00.000
if you're using java unfortunately,
while java technically has an

192 
00:12:00.328 --> 00:12:04.000
accessibility architecture er a lot of
it doesn't really work that well or in

193 
00:12:04.478 --> 00:12:08.000
some cases really at all so this is
unfortunate not because you know it

194 
00:12:08.838 --> 00:12:12.000
just is but because if you're a
developer you might be thinking all

195 
00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:15.000
right i'm going code to the
accessibility interface is gonna be

196 
00:12:15.112 --> 00:12:18.000
awesome gonna make this totally
accessible and then you turn it on on a

197 
00:12:18.602 --> 00:12:19.000
particular platform and you're like,

198 
00:12:20.332 --> 00:12:24.000
oh, it doesn't work and you can verify
that by turning on the screen which

199 
00:12:24.192 --> 00:12:27.000
you're free often times and so you just
flip it on and say oh, it doesnt make

200 
00:12:27.532 --> 00:12:28.000
sound i'll give an example

201 
00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:33.000
in the net beans development
environment second two of programmers

202 
00:12:33.542 --> 00:12:37.000
the text editor didn't work for years
so it's like the fundamental thing like

203 
00:12:37.992 --> 00:12:41.000
about how to use a development
environment like writing text but it

204 
00:12:41.972 --> 00:12:43.000
was not accessible what was wrong with

205 
00:12:44.012 --> 00:12:49.000
job is accessibility system doesn't
work wow and it's you know it is what

206 
00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:49.000
it is

207 
00:12:50.062 --> 00:12:54.000
and there are other there are other
types of environments that are much

208 
00:12:54.312 --> 00:12:55.000
more accessible so for example

209 
00:12:56.002 --> 00:13:00.000
microsoft for whatever reason gets flak
a lot but for accessibility they've got

210 
00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:05.000
a pretty dang good job right they ap
eyes worked pretty well they're not

211 
00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:09.000
perfect but there well thought through
over many years and they're compatible

212 
00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:14.000
with a lot of systems is not a plug for
microsoft i've no vested interest but

213 
00:13:14.862 --> 00:13:17.000
they have this thing called i
accessible to and basically if you

214 
00:13:17.882 --> 00:13:22.000
kowtow accessible to then your stuff is
almost certain to be accessible but if

215 
00:13:22.022 --> 00:13:25.000
you're working at sort of a higher
level then sort of the little level old

216 
00:13:25.342 --> 00:13:29.000
calm type stuff and you're just using
sheet c sharp they've done a pretty

217 
00:13:29.702 --> 00:13:34.000
damn good job of like building it in so
that buttons and text boxes and stuff

218 
00:13:34.242 --> 00:13:37.000
like that are mostly accessible night
so if you stick with

219 
00:13:38.172 --> 00:13:42.000
development tools from big platforms
usually there are okay, well, it

220 
00:13:42.612 --> 00:13:46.000
depends on the platform job is pretty
big too, but it's debatable whether

221 
00:13:46.282 --> 00:13:50.000
it's accessible depending on platform
where c sharp is at least pretty dang

222 
00:13:50.812 --> 00:13:55.000
accessible on windows and there's a mac,
they do have something called an s

223 
00:13:55.052 --> 00:13:55.000
accessible

224 
00:13:56.012 --> 00:13:59.000
and that does work pretty well if
you're on ly writing in the mac go

225 
00:13:59.332 --> 00:13:59.000
system,

226 
00:14:00.062 --> 00:14:02.000
the tricky thing is, whenever you're
using other programming languages in

227 
00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:07.000
those ecosystems like, for example, is
small talk accessible is python

228 
00:14:07.452 --> 00:14:12.000
accessible it's kind of you have to
take it on a case by case basis because

229 
00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:17.000
of the platform yeah see of those tools
but by from the windows is different

230 
00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:17.000
from biting a mech

231 
00:14:18.049 --> 00:14:23.000
candy. It depends on what the dabs
implemented. So so there still some to

232 
00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:26.000
some things that we need to know about
nest developers because the platforms

233 
00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:30.000
are going to take care of it? Yeah, in
fact, this is one reason why i've cared

234 
00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:33.000
about the consistency of programming
languages in part because it impacts

235 
00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:36.000
some groups pretty poorly, like the
blind, you know, like

236 
00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:40.000
i'll give an example are tools for the
blind, i think your written in like,

237 
00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:43.000
eight programming languages and we
don't want them to be, but we have to

238 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:46.000
connect to these different systems.
There's really no choice, something

239 
00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:48.000
like that sixty eight i forget a lot

240 
00:14:49.109 --> 00:14:49.000
a lot here

241 
00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:55.000
is not of the books. So what about
other things that we should take care

242 
00:14:55.309 --> 00:14:58.000
of? So one of things that has surprised
me a lot in working with, like children

243 
00:14:58.869 --> 00:15:04.000
only a little bit is that some stuff
like working with the mouse takes lots

244 
00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:08.000
of energy if you're visually impaired
but not entirely blind so you can see a

245 
00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:12.000
little bit, so we sighted people would
think, oh, you can use the mouse, but

246 
00:15:12.739 --> 00:15:16.000
tracing where the mouse cursor is and
using the mouse takes lots of energy

247 
00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:20.000
that was this thing that surprised me
loans are there are a few other things

248 
00:15:20.369 --> 00:15:24.000
that we like this that we should think
about, yeah, and actually there's some

249 
00:15:24.209 --> 00:15:27.000
stuff that greeted hui tool kit
designers khun do that are pretty easy.

250 
00:15:27.609 --> 00:15:32.000
So for example, if you're designing
some kind of a text box type interface

251 
00:15:32.059 --> 00:15:34.000
and it doesn't have any textbooks but
something that you would follow a

252 
00:15:34.569 --> 00:15:38.000
pointer whenever the point your moves,
if someone is magnified, follow it

253 
00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:42.000
right so that if you're moving a
magnification system, they always have

254 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:46.000
the context of where the most important
thing is i'm sort of full focus should

255 
00:15:46.609 --> 00:15:51.000
full of occurred are yes ok, yeah so
like if you're like for example, one of

256 
00:15:51.099 --> 00:15:55.000
my old students i shouldn't say his
name since you know, because he happens

257 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:16:01.000
to be blind right? And he used a
magnifier pretty heavily and when he

258 
00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:05.000
would use just typical gooey elements
for example, imagine if you pressed a

259 
00:16:05.149 --> 00:16:08.000
button and opened a menu, but it didn't
jump to that menu and you're highly

260 
00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:12.000
magnified it's a lot easier if the
magnification system follows you but

261 
00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:15.000
not all the operating systems do that.
Oh, and then you'd have to scroll,

262 
00:16:15.998 --> 00:16:20.000
which is super hard yes magnify yeah,
so i clicked the menu and then have to,

263 
00:16:20.118 --> 00:16:23.000
like, tap the mouse a bunch to sort of
get it up there and hope that you can

264 
00:16:23.848 --> 00:16:28.000
find it the gets tricky so focus is a
big issue focuses a huge issue you

265 
00:16:28.838 --> 00:16:29.000
rejection,

266 
00:16:30.128 --> 00:16:35.000
any order, huge issues like that let's
see so for in terms of trying to make

267 
00:16:35.348 --> 00:16:39.000
general user interfaces accessible won
that my team has been working on that i

268 
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.000
think it's really fun is we've been
trying to figure out how to make

269 
00:16:41.928 --> 00:16:45.000
graphics accessible, so here here's the
tricky part if you've got something

270 
00:16:45.828 --> 00:16:49.000
like like let's just say unity three d
which is sort of like this game

271 
00:16:49.438 --> 00:16:52.000
designed platform right? We have ah
grant from the national science

272 
00:16:52.898 --> 00:16:54.000
foundation right now to try to take

273 
00:16:55.088 --> 00:16:58.000
big, complicated three d interfaces
like that make him buy accessible but

274 
00:16:58.458 --> 00:17:02.000
here's the rub well, you could make
buttons and stuff like that accessible

275 
00:17:02.248 --> 00:17:05.000
there's just no way you can tell open g
l make yourself blind accessible there

276 
00:17:05.778 --> 00:17:10.000
just is no tool it is inherent visual
it is inherently visual accept any kind

277 
00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:14.000
of three d application still has things
you could potentially tele screen

278 
00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:18.000
reader about so for example, if i'm
navigating terrain or something like

279 
00:17:18.508 --> 00:17:21.000
that are trying to adjust to rain or a
three d model hypothetically you could

280 
00:17:21.928 --> 00:17:26.000
provide a list of things that could be
positions on that terrain and tell it

281 
00:17:26.137 --> 00:17:26.000
to go up and down

282 
00:17:27.028 --> 00:17:28.000
which would still give a screen reader
information.

283 
00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:33.000
So one of the things we're trying to
invent in the lab is a way for blind

284 
00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:36.000
children to be able to write their own
three d computer games and be able to

285 
00:17:36.408 --> 00:17:39.000
adjust it through their typical
screening device without needing any

286 
00:17:39.618 --> 00:17:42.000
special stuff while still having it the
hardware accelerated and all that stuff

287 
00:17:43.298 --> 00:17:47.000
it's been a hard project that's taking
me four years to get a handle around in

288 
00:17:47.388 --> 00:17:49.000
my brain but i think we're getting
pretty close

289 
00:17:50.068 --> 00:17:54.000
and are those things that also usable
for let's say more practical things

290 
00:17:54.828 --> 00:18:00.000
that are inherently visual i'm thinking
off a diagram or a map or a graph see

291 
00:18:00.668 --> 00:18:03.000
that's the thing if you could do that
for the hard stuff and graphics any of

292 
00:18:03.938 --> 00:18:05.000
the rest comes comes easily yeah

293 
00:18:06.848 --> 00:18:10.000
oh yeah we talked about frameworks and
libraries ready a little bit. So you

294 
00:18:10.528 --> 00:18:15.000
mentioned and ass accessible that's a
framework that we can use to make stuff

295 
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:19.000
more accessible? Sort of out of the
books are there are other things we

296 
00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:23.000
should check out frameworks of
libraries. Yeah, the big one's, the big.

297 
00:18:23.738 --> 00:18:27.000
The two biggest ones are anice
accessible on mac and i accessible to

298 
00:18:27.688 --> 00:18:33.000
on windows. But i think since in terms
of the web, by far the two things that

299 
00:18:33.038 --> 00:18:35.000
people should know about the w three c
accessibility standards

300 
00:18:36.068 --> 00:18:37.000
and also this thing called aria

301 
00:18:38.158 --> 00:18:42.000
this mildly mildly hard to google
sometimes you don't have to say a r i a

302 
00:18:42.638 --> 00:18:44.000
space accessibility,

303 
00:18:45.678 --> 00:18:49.000
but the idea is that the w three c
standards sort of tell you any pretty

304 
00:18:49.998 --> 00:18:54.000
much anything you would need to know
about basic like content. And the aria

305 
00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:57.000
standards are really good at trying to
help you understand like interactive

306 
00:18:57.488 --> 00:19:00.000
content, cool or audio up to a jag
stuff things like that

307 
00:19:01.028 --> 00:19:04.000
we'll make sure we at all of that to
the show notes so people that want to

308 
00:19:04.058 --> 00:19:05.000
know more comtech it out the sleeve

309 
00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:13.000
so so far we've mainly talked about to
everyday tools that many people use

310 
00:19:13.248 --> 00:19:15.000
like a website or an actor or a phone

311 
00:19:16.468 --> 00:19:21.000
but there's also people that program
while blinds and we use the vespers

312 
00:19:21.888 --> 00:19:27.000
might make tools for people that want a
program also more accessible so i want

313 
00:19:27.258 --> 00:19:33.000
to talk about that a little bit how do
blind people program and what should we

314 
00:19:33.128 --> 00:19:38.000
know by blind developers to make
developed tools more assessable yes so

315 
00:19:38.008 --> 00:19:42.000
actually blind developers fall into the
same category so either visually

316 
00:19:42.558 --> 00:19:43.000
impaired or totally blind

317 
00:19:44.128 --> 00:19:48.000
and they do amazingly interesting
things. So for example

318 
00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:52.000
a number of line developers that design
technologies for all sorts of things

319 
00:19:52.388 --> 00:19:56.000
one of one of my good friends his name
is signor graham he designs

320 
00:19:56.658 --> 00:20:00.000
accessibility installations for museums
he he won this award from the white

321 
00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:03.000
house a bunch of years back and got
connected with museums all over the

322 
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:06.000
world to build like weird, accessible
interfaces and stuff like that if you

323 
00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:09.000
go to your museum there's an accessible
thing it's very likely he's been

324 
00:20:09.928 --> 00:20:12.000
involved in some capacity or another.
So what are we thinking about

325 
00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:17.000
accessible museums then someone that's
describing the painting i could be all

326 
00:20:17.503 --> 00:20:20.000
sorts of stuff and to be honest, i'm
not exactly sure all the details of

327 
00:20:20.363 --> 00:20:23.000
what he does but i've seen like some
stuff here and there it seems pretty

328 
00:20:23.823 --> 00:20:25.000
cool but the point is as

329 
00:20:26.063 --> 00:20:29.000
the point isn't so much the details of
what he does it's how he does it so how

330 
00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:33.000
does he do it? So what he does is he
uses his screen reader and then he

331 
00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:37.000
listens to the text now there's some
obvious complexity there so for example,

332 
00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:37.000
if you

333 
00:20:38.263 --> 00:20:42.000
two sided users sometimes as developers
we don't really think about the sort of

334 
00:20:42.523 --> 00:20:46.000
weird wacky syntax that happens but is
a blind developer you literally have to

335 
00:20:46.783 --> 00:20:50.000
listen to for left brandon cycle zero
cynical and i was intense public alumni

336 
00:20:50.243 --> 00:20:50.000
list i

337 
00:20:51.073 --> 00:20:55.000
suppose right friend left brace
yourself like that so it's free reader

338 
00:20:55.143 --> 00:20:59.000
that's normally used for text is then
used in source code and it just reads

339 
00:20:59.613 --> 00:21:03.000
old symbols yeah and it's not like you
can't get used to it but the problem is

340 
00:21:03.933 --> 00:21:07.000
it depends you know a lot on like where
you are in the development pipeline

341 
00:21:07.113 --> 00:21:09.000
like if you're an experienced super
experienced professional

342 
00:21:10.033 --> 00:21:12.000
you've already made it past all the
barriers and you're good to go

343 
00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:16.000
then yeah, you're going to be fine, but
we've also spent a lot of time talking

344 
00:21:16.673 --> 00:21:20.000
to blind children and let's just say
the first time that a blind child hears

345 
00:21:20.333 --> 00:21:23.000
for left handed like was there a some
clothes i wasn't sent simon cohen on

346 
00:21:23.413 --> 00:21:24.000
post post right prem left grace

347 
00:21:25.053 --> 00:21:28.000
it's a little weird and it sort of
makes you wonder why languages are

348 
00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:29.000
built that way

349 
00:21:30.843 --> 00:21:36.000
for enough so for the let's say end
user tools we talked about navigation

350 
00:21:36.643 --> 00:21:41.000
being a huge issue i can imagine that
is for programming as well i think if i

351 
00:21:41.793 --> 00:21:46.000
read golden and infirm eriks code base
i would scroll open on to see what

352 
00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:48.000
other classes when other methods

353 
00:21:49.323 --> 00:21:53.000
how does the screen reader for blind
people navigate smersh code? Because

354 
00:21:53.633 --> 00:21:57.000
does it have hatters there's a take the
contacts into account or you could skip

355 
00:21:57.323 --> 00:21:58.000
from the one class to the other

356 
00:21:59.253 --> 00:22:04.000
yes and no so it does but in the same
way you know how when you're using a

357 
00:22:04.613 --> 00:22:07.000
development tool oftentimes you might
have a little like navigators off to

358 
00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:10.000
the side and it'll have the list of the
classes and methods you click on him

359 
00:22:11.423 --> 00:22:15.000
oftentimes those air accessible so you
can still jump around. However, that

360 
00:22:15.763 --> 00:22:20.000
doesn't mean it's easy, so when you're
done, i think one of the harder things

361 
00:22:20.469 --> 00:22:25.000
for blind individuals is that you can
navigate a little bit and there's a

362 
00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:27.000
number of research teams that are
working on making those navigators

363 
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:31.000
better. But the one of the trickier
part of if you've got like a long

364 
00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:35.000
method, getting context can be
difficult. So you know twenty lines of

365 
00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:38.000
really complicated code you have to
kind of memorize it to figure out

366 
00:22:38.229 --> 00:22:42.000
what's going on depending upon what
you're doing oh so you're saying if you

367 
00:22:42.209 --> 00:22:43.000
want to comprehend and methods

368 
00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:47.000
maybe you read one line read another
line but you need to remember all of

369 
00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:51.000
those whereas if you recited the fell
apart you could skip down to maybe the

370 
00:22:51.499 --> 00:22:55.000
loop that's in the methods and like, oh,
it loops over all the customers are

371 
00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:59.000
whatever that's yeah exactly so like if
i'm looking at a screen of code, i can

372 
00:22:59.399 --> 00:23:03.000
kind of glance up and down to get very
quick context that's a little bit

373 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:04.000
harder if you're blind or i guess

374 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:08.000
many of my blind friends would probably
say that it's not this way harder but

375 
00:23:08.439 --> 00:23:09.000
maybe slower yeah

376 
00:23:10.059 --> 00:23:12.000
or different different yeah

377 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:19.000
arter things we can do as developers in
that respect, what can we do to make

378 
00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:23.000
developer tools more accessible? For
example, that navigation can we make

379 
00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:26.000
resource go more easily navigate herbal

380 
00:23:27.109 --> 00:23:32.000
for source code it's tough? I think
that the bigger issues are number one

381 
00:23:32.499 --> 00:23:36.000
many of the development ides aren't
very accessible or if they are

382 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:38.000
accessible they sort of break every
other release

383 
00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:42.000
and it's again it's not like it's
malicious or anything it's just people

384 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.000
don't think about it.

385 
00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:49.000
So for example visual studio is sort of
accessible right now, but historically

386 
00:23:49.509 --> 00:23:53.000
it's sort of you know is sort of
accessible sort of not depending on the

387 
00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:59.000
release or even if it is accessible for
certain ieds sometimes they make rather

388 
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:03.000
adorable decisions, so for example i
remember boyfriend which version of

389 
00:24:03.829 --> 00:24:07.000
visual studio it was but i recall there
was a little too bugger label and had

390 
00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:11.000
an arrow wanted and so if europe a
blind person or like let's say a child

391 
00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:14.000
instead of giving you information about
what you're doing in the departure

392 
00:24:14.579 --> 00:24:14.000
would say like

393 
00:24:15.009 --> 00:24:19.000
graphic fifty three and it's like i get
it you can learn that but it's sort of

394 
00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:23.000
weird you have to write so is that what
you mean with short of accessible can

395 
00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:27.000
you explain a little bit more more
detail what what does it mean if

396 
00:24:27.056 --> 00:24:32.000
something is sword off accessible it
was sort off what is it and what parts

397 
00:24:32.486 --> 00:24:35.000
is inaccessible and what parts isn't it
i'm trying to think how to describe

398 
00:24:35.906 --> 00:24:39.000
this like have you ever been on a
website and like you could use it but

399 
00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:45.000
it's sort of bothered you yeah doesn't
fuel logical right like the links are

400 
00:24:45.976 --> 00:24:49.000
on weird places and it looks strange
and stuff like that that's true for

401 
00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:55.000
accessible interface is a cz well so
example if you're a page wasn't

402 
00:24:55.636 --> 00:24:59.000
structured with proper formatting then
you wouldn't be able to navigate its

403 
00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:03.000
you might go to like go up and down
with bunch of giant paragraphs but you

404 
00:25:03.886 --> 00:25:08.000
would definitely be annoyed and with
ideas is kind of a similar situation

405 
00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:11.000
it's sort of like you might be able to
navigate the source code editor but

406 
00:25:11.976 --> 00:25:15.000
maybe navigation doesn't work maybe
certain features are broken maybe

407 
00:25:15.906 --> 00:25:18.000
you'll get to certain windows you can't
navigate through amore

408 
00:25:19.076 --> 00:25:22.000
the preferences window won't be
accessible with the other windows are

409 
00:25:22.466 --> 00:25:24.000
maybe the file save dialogue is broken
so

410 
00:25:25.136 --> 00:25:26.000
that this is the thing is that a lot of
these

411 
00:25:27.006 --> 00:25:27.000
id's

412 
00:25:28.096 --> 00:25:30.000
is not so much that they're good or bad
is a whole ofthe times they're just

413 
00:25:30.866 --> 00:25:35.000
weirdly inconsistent, so certain
interfaces will be broken for a release

414 
00:25:35.076 --> 00:25:35.000
or two

415 
00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:39.000
makes it kind of hard, especially if
you're lerner, but for professionals to

416 
00:25:39.926 --> 00:25:40.000
yeah could measure

417 
00:25:41.596 --> 00:25:45.000
inconsistency is bad for any
demographic? Yeah, pretty much and i

418 
00:25:45.596 --> 00:25:49.000
think it's easy for a deaf to
accidentally screwed up because they

419 
00:25:49.466 --> 00:25:50.000
don't do it every like there.

420 
00:25:51.026 --> 00:25:54.000
I think a lot of designers they don't
usually test with the screen reader,

421 
00:25:54.656 --> 00:25:58.000
and so they don't really notice when
something is broken for the blind. Yeah,

422 
00:25:58.186 --> 00:26:03.000
going to that point, what are things we
could do if we are in the field off

423 
00:26:03.676 --> 00:26:08.000
making id's or mention any plug ins?
One thing we could do is tested with a

424 
00:26:08.106 --> 00:26:10.000
scream. Rainier do you have other
concrete tips?

425 
00:26:11.076 --> 00:26:15.000
Suppose we're in the business of
developing iii's are related to that or

426 
00:26:15.356 --> 00:26:19.000
for programmers, what do we need to
check so there's a few things? Number

427 
00:26:19.506 --> 00:26:22.000
one is if you're at a big company and
you have the cash, you can get a

428 
00:26:22.856 --> 00:26:26.000
consultant to help because it is tricky
and so don't assume that like you have

429 
00:26:26.701 --> 00:26:30.000
to figure it all out yourself there's
lots of people out there that know how

430 
00:26:30.691 --> 00:26:35.000
to do it and that can help with it,
especially on the web. The web is not

431 
00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:39.000
perfect nowadays but it's so much
better today than it was, you know,

432 
00:26:39.511 --> 00:26:40.000
twenty years ago whatever

433 
00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:43.000
and so that's number one

434 
00:26:44.001 --> 00:26:44.000
number two

435 
00:26:45.251 --> 00:26:48.000
even though definitely turning on a
screen reader is a good thing and can

436 
00:26:48.891 --> 00:26:54.000
help figure stuff out the the one
tricky thing to do is to check it

437 
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:58.000
compared to a variety of disability. So
think that one thing just kind of go

438 
00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:00.000
through a checklist of what those could
be. So for example,

439 
00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:04.000
if you are totally blind, you might use
a screen reader but ifyou're visually

440 
00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:06.000
impaired, which is a lie a lot more
people

441 
00:27:07.341 --> 00:27:07.000
than

442 
00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:11.000
you might think of issues like color
contrast and those air on light there's

443 
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:16.000
only checkers for that and it's really
easy to do and even if you're not blind

444 
00:27:16.341 --> 00:27:17.000
that's helpful there too because like
the

445 
00:27:18.281 --> 00:27:22.000
color contrast helps people read your
page, people could be colorblind, they

446 
00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:24.000
benefit they could also be colorblind,
but they could also just like it makes

447 
00:27:24.891 --> 00:27:28.000
it easier to read like, for example,
you know if you have black text on

448 
00:27:28.331 --> 00:27:31.000
white background that's really easy to
read but black text on dark gray

449 
00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:35.000
background maybe not so much and so a
lot of the issues that you do with

450 
00:27:35.591 --> 00:27:39.000
accessibility they tend to have these
other little benefits like your sight

451 
00:27:39.321 --> 00:27:41.000
is generally easier reading so

452 
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:47.000
so that our top tips get consultant's
help if you can pay for it or use your

453 
00:27:47.881 --> 00:27:52.000
own at or website or idee with a screen
radio and we'll just see how it feels

454 
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:56.000
screen reader enabled but also don't
forget that the visually impaired

455 
00:27:56.261 --> 00:27:58.000
community is larger than the totally
blind community

456 
00:27:59.051 --> 00:28:03.000
so think about things like
magnification color contrasts and stuff

457 
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:06.000
like that you know we haven't really
talked about the braille interface and

458 
00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.000
lords oh yeah actually

459 
00:28:09.081 --> 00:28:12.000
it sounds weird but actually a lot of
the blind community doesn't actually

460 
00:28:12.251 --> 00:28:16.000
know braille that is present yeah it's
sort of a bizarre quirks but think

461 
00:28:16.721 --> 00:28:20.000
about it like this if you're blind and
you go blind later in life, the

462 
00:28:20.861 --> 00:28:24.000
question is do i just turn on a screen
reader which i can download at no cost

463 
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:28.000
or die by rail to speed for like three
to ten thousand dollars and have to

464 
00:28:28.485 --> 00:28:29.000
learn braille right?

465 
00:28:30.335 --> 00:28:34.000
So it's kind of a barrier however, if
you're at if you're a young person and

466 
00:28:34.715 --> 00:28:39.000
you know blind from birth or or very
young oftentimes it's a good idea to

467 
00:28:39.695 --> 00:28:41.000
learn braille skills because it's a
nice way to read

468 
00:28:42.125 --> 00:28:47.000
i'm so far as i understand it but for
us as developers the bro interface is

469 
00:28:47.135 --> 00:28:51.000
not as big of a chunk of the people we
could reach as is optimized more scream

470 
00:28:51.265 --> 00:28:55.000
read that's true and if it if your
interface is accessible you most of the

471 
00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:59.000
time get the railing sign for free now
there is some tricky stuff like for

472 
00:28:59.445 --> 00:29:04.000
example, braille standards change over
time and computer symbols in braille

473 
00:29:04.305 --> 00:29:05.000
like that using programming language

474 
00:29:06.215 --> 00:29:09.000
languages don't always come out well,
so there's really getting really

475 
00:29:10.275 --> 00:29:13.000
i'm not exactly sure which ones i have
a friend that's a braille expert and

476 
00:29:13.825 --> 00:29:17.000
i'm that's not it sounds like you would
know about all these things, but a lot

477 
00:29:17.565 --> 00:29:21.000
of these really complicated and braille
is one of those areas i know less about,

478 
00:29:21.405 --> 00:29:25.000
but yet little weird symbols that we
often use in programming languages for

479 
00:29:25.085 --> 00:29:25.000
whatever reason,

480 
00:29:26.945 --> 00:29:27.000
so so far we

481 
00:29:28.005 --> 00:29:28.000
talked about tools,

482 
00:29:29.005 --> 00:29:32.000
abs websites and e what thing that's
really important to developers that we

483 
00:29:32.945 --> 00:29:34.000
haven't covered is the comm outline?

484 
00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:37.000
Does this create a way to work on the
command line? What does it read?

485 
00:29:38.015 --> 00:29:38.000
Is that

486 
00:29:39.455 --> 00:29:43.000
better interface for people that are
visually impaired than running it from

487 
00:29:43.675 --> 00:29:44.000
a nineteen you for example,

488 
00:29:45.015 --> 00:29:48.000
i say i wouldn't say it's better, but
it's definitely most of the time

489 
00:29:48.655 --> 00:29:49.000
they're accessible, so

490 
00:29:50.085 --> 00:29:54.000
a command line interface is definitely
a nice fall back, but when you think

491 
00:29:54.975 --> 00:29:58.000
about it oftentimes when your
programming a command line interface is

492 
00:29:58.225 --> 00:30:02.000
okay, but id's offing all sorts of
stuff like auto factoring and all that

493 
00:30:02.335 --> 00:30:02.000
all that

494 
00:30:03.255 --> 00:30:06.000
so sometimes it is nice to be able to
use an i d which is why, you know,

495 
00:30:06.725 --> 00:30:10.000
people think prefer it however a
command line interface is almost always

496 
00:30:10.645 --> 00:30:14.000
accessible, which is why it's not a bad
option if you have to. Okay, so it's a

497 
00:30:14.115 --> 00:30:17.000
good idea to have come out into freight
kamala and phrase because it sort of

498 
00:30:17.645 --> 00:30:20.000
assessment by default yeah, you're
probably gonna have accessibility

499 
00:30:20.415 --> 00:30:24.000
support if you use one, you know? So
you briefly touched the bone re

500 
00:30:24.505 --> 00:30:29.000
factoring support as one of the things
that an i d offers us sighted people

501 
00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:30.000
are those

502 
00:30:31.164 --> 00:30:35.000
features that blind people can use
because if i think of you factoring i e

503 
00:30:35.594 --> 00:30:39.000
i think of many things that are visual
let's say the rename refractory

504 
00:30:40.144 --> 00:30:44.000
i think of selecting a variable i think
of right clicking, getting a context

505 
00:30:44.024 --> 00:30:48.000
menu, selecting renamed rue factoring,
getting a bull pup that says what's the

506 
00:30:48.844 --> 00:30:53.000
new name getting a preview of how my
source code would look like in a new

507 
00:30:53.164 --> 00:30:57.000
version is like visual, visual, visual
visual yeah, it sounds like it wouldn't

508 
00:30:57.614 --> 00:31:01.000
be, but they usually are yeah, and then
we have to be but they usually are yeah,

509 
00:31:01.884 --> 00:31:05.000
and the reason is because they no, most
of the time, they use normal, gooey

510 
00:31:05.234 --> 00:31:08.000
elements like context, menus and stuff
like you're saying, and most of the

511 
00:31:08.664 --> 00:31:12.000
time, if you program it correctly and,
like java, isn't broken for

512 
00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:12.000
accessibility,

513 
00:31:13.174 --> 00:31:14.000
then yes, they're accessible.

514 
00:31:15.404 --> 00:31:18.000
But i should say, i'm not trying to
pick on java is just happens to be not

515 
00:31:18.284 --> 00:31:20.000
accessible if that's the way it is, the
weakness.

516 
00:31:21.334 --> 00:31:22.000
I was also thinking about

517 
00:31:23.004 --> 00:31:25.000
testing, which also is often

518 
00:31:26.004 --> 00:31:29.000
inherently visual in the sense that
failing tests would get mad,

519 
00:31:30.284 --> 00:31:31.000
i thought, yeah, yeah,

520 
00:31:32.334 --> 00:31:36.000
just do scream readers read those
thoughts. I'm not sure about the

521 
00:31:36.284 --> 00:31:39.000
specific interface for, like j unit or
something, but

522 
00:31:40.254 --> 00:31:43.000
generally speaking, those things can be
coded to be accessible. And also you

523 
00:31:43.804 --> 00:31:46.000
can just dump it to the command line
and then it'll be accessible. Teo far

524 
00:31:46.834 --> 00:31:48.000
enough. And what about quigley's?

525 
00:31:50.744 --> 00:31:54.000
Okay, that's tricky. So there's are a
few things in

526 
00:31:55.184 --> 00:31:56.000
interfaces that are highly visual

527 
00:31:57.014 --> 00:32:02.000
aren't super accessible, so little
squid lee's actually are, believe it or

528 
00:32:02.014 --> 00:32:05.000
not, or at least you could make them
and there's a couple ways you can do it.

529 
00:32:05.244 --> 00:32:10.000
One is what we do in some of our tools
with wind. When you have a squiggly at

530 
00:32:10.394 --> 00:32:14.000
the very, very like point, one seconds
will go like something like that so

531 
00:32:14.934 --> 00:32:17.000
that way the thing is is that you need
it to be right at the beginning of the

532 
00:32:17.674 --> 00:32:21.000
lancastrian eyebrows you'll be like
going up and down between variables

533 
00:32:21.204 --> 00:32:22.000
like this line this line

534 
00:32:23.324 --> 00:32:26.000
and then you can hear right away that
there's an error on the line. So then

535 
00:32:26.384 --> 00:32:29.000
in that case you might you can either
query for the air you can check your

536 
00:32:29.474 --> 00:32:33.000
compile bach or you can wait to the end
of the line and we embedded at the end

537 
00:32:33.158 --> 00:32:33.000
of the line

538 
00:32:34.208 --> 00:32:38.000
so then it would be different from how
signing people would perceive it

539 
00:32:38.088 --> 00:32:42.000
because for us the squiggly sometimes
is not in there the entire line but in

540 
00:32:42.258 --> 00:32:46.000
a in the departure of the line that is
the issue. Oh, yeah, clarity will be

541 
00:32:46.478 --> 00:32:49.000
slightly different because you get the
error at the beginning of the line

542 
00:32:50.118 --> 00:32:54.000
so it's a bit less, i think that's
right information. Yeah, but that's ok,

543 
00:32:54.888 --> 00:33:00.000
cool. So all these things that we
perceive as visual are understandable

544 
00:33:00.138 --> 00:33:04.000
for blind users. Really? Sometimes i
mean, there are tricky ones. I was just

545 
00:33:04.598 --> 00:33:08.000
thinking of one s o if you ever used
one of those like interfaces for gifts

546 
00:33:08.868 --> 00:33:13.000
that are highly visual def so yeah, you
get like red is just lines and green is

547 
00:33:13.568 --> 00:33:17.000
the same lines compared to the previous
committed or to moscow yeah, it would

548 
00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:20.000
be awesome if those were accessible but
i'm not totally sure how to do it

549 
00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:20.000
because

550 
00:33:21.158 --> 00:33:24.000
they're really, really visual and they
often use non standard components

551 
00:33:25.198 --> 00:33:27.000
so like custom little drawing tools and
things like that

552 
00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:32.000
so i think it's probably possible i've
just uh never trying you in theory you

553 
00:33:32.568 --> 00:33:35.000
could have something similar where you
have the cliques at the beginning of

554 
00:33:35.428 --> 00:33:35.000
the line

555 
00:33:36.008 --> 00:33:39.000
for what is red and green for one
that's the same yeah and blind people

556 
00:33:39.838 --> 00:33:43.000
definitely can and do use version
control so for example i know we used

557 
00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:47.000
to have a number of blind children
doing lego robot competitions and so

558 
00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:50.000
they would use i fire akane correctly
they'd use get to send files back and

559 
00:33:50.708 --> 00:33:52.000
forth to each other because the command
lines

560 
00:33:53.128 --> 00:33:57.000
accessible and we make it accessible in
some of our little ideas to you just we

561 
00:33:57.158 --> 00:34:01.000
just could never get like visual
defying working thing is a hard problem

562 
00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:04.000
in general even for people that can see
it kind of is and even if you get it on

563 
00:34:04.418 --> 00:34:07.000
the command line all those weird little
get symbols yeah, those air unreadable

564 
00:34:07.968 --> 00:34:10.000
by anybody yeah they're waiting for me
in me too

565 
00:34:11.858 --> 00:34:15.000
i want to talk a little bit more about
the process of development so suppose

566 
00:34:15.728 --> 00:34:19.000
you were a blind or visually impaired
developer inside the company and you

567 
00:34:19.168 --> 00:34:20.000
want to communicate architecture

568 
00:34:21.277 --> 00:34:25.000
how would you use your mel diagram
generally speaking, you ml is not

569 
00:34:25.558 --> 00:34:30.000
accessible at all on dh when i say that
what i mean is that oftentimes you emma

570 
00:34:30.848 --> 00:34:34.000
was rendered in some way so you could
do it if you either had a graphical

571 
00:34:34.588 --> 00:34:35.000
render some other approach

572 
00:34:36.168 --> 00:34:41.000
however oftentimes all you, um it'll
really does is provide you a sense of

573 
00:34:41.197 --> 00:34:41.000
the structure

574 
00:34:42.078 --> 00:34:45.000
and there's lots of ways to navigate
structure. So in other words, if you're

575 
00:34:45.678 --> 00:34:48.000
out of design meeting and you put uml
up on the board yeah that's not gonna

576 
00:34:48.878 --> 00:34:53.000
help but if you have like a development
tool where you can navigate the classes

577 
00:34:53.398 --> 00:34:56.000
and read the code, then that's the way
that you could be inclusive of a person

578 
00:34:56.748 --> 00:34:59.000
that's blind even if the rest of the
team is using uml at the same time.

579 
00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:04.000
So as long as it's a textural and
structural representation you can

580 
00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:08.000
represent class iran's but the visual
version would be very tricky pretty

581 
00:35:08.218 --> 00:35:11.000
much now there was a really cool
dissertation done on a few years back.

582 
00:35:11.528 --> 00:35:13.000
I think the guy's name was alistair
king

583 
00:35:14.138 --> 00:35:15.000
and his great work

584 
00:35:16.148 --> 00:35:20.000
but i don't think that there's really a
lot that's happened to make it

585 
00:35:20.238 --> 00:35:23.000
accessible besides one person's serious,
dedicated effort

586 
00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:27.000
yeah, so that's something if we develop
there the fella person we want to be

587 
00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:30.000
inclusive of people back and see your
can see well

588 
00:35:31.548 --> 00:35:35.000
we just shoot a news diagrams we should
keep to structural information that is

589 
00:35:35.198 --> 00:35:38.000
in the code base rather than auxiliary
document yeah, i mean and you know how

590 
00:35:38.808 --> 00:35:42.000
this stuff is anyway it kind of gets
out of date and whether yeah, yeah, i'm

591 
00:35:42.108 --> 00:35:45.000
sure there are also a few dissertations
that say, well, the jumiller grams

592 
00:35:46.008 --> 00:35:49.000
they got outdated super quickly, right?
Or have you read that wonderful paper

593 
00:35:49.818 --> 00:35:53.000
by marion petrie? You know which one
i'm talking about? No, i don't think i

594 
00:35:53.248 --> 00:35:56.000
do what's the thing that i think it's
called you a melon practice

595 
00:35:57.108 --> 00:36:01.000
she basically asked the question of do
people actually use uml? And the answer

596 
00:36:01.448 --> 00:36:03.000
was pretty much not much yeah,

597 
00:36:04.008 --> 00:36:09.000
so i mean macy paper thinking he was an
ex way linked to that is shown in its

598 
00:36:09.318 --> 00:36:11.000
look very related to distort it but
it's a great paper,

599 
00:36:12.888 --> 00:36:17.000
ok, so far we've talked about it
sensibility in tools, websites and for

600 
00:36:17.118 --> 00:36:21.000
programming environment, so talk a
little bit about your work because you

601 
00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:25.000
have developed a programming system
that is inclusive off blind and

602 
00:36:25.698 --> 00:36:26.000
visually impaired children

603 
00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:33.000
it's only more so one of the
observations that we made right away

604 
00:36:33.028 --> 00:36:37.000
was that although you could do some
work to make some of the tools or ideas

605 
00:36:37.188 --> 00:36:38.000
or development environments accessible,

606 
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.000
some of the barriers that we saw
students still having we're with the

607 
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:44.000
languages themselves and at the time

608 
00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:49.000
we made this sort of really innocent
had this sort of really innocent

609 
00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.000
question, which was why

610 
00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.000
two languages have that design anyway
and what was the evidence for that

611 
00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:00.000
decision? So for example, if you have a
for loop in a language it's entirely

612 
00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.000
reasonable that that might be the case
but

613 
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.000
why did they use the word for

614 
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.000
and what was the evidence for that
choice? Because it wasn't just one

615 
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.000
person that that impacted right like
languages were used by millions of

616 
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.000
people all over the world, so we might
expect that

617 
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
you could just hypothetically go to the
programming language designed

618 
00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.000
literature, look it up and figure out
why they made certain decisions and

619 
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:26.000
you're also thinking about that case
where you say a four loop is pronounced

620 
00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.000
as for over brackett, i've rested
russian

621 
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.000
very known you're a bull or old double
if you have to read it by screaming,

622 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:38.000
yeah, exactly so it wasn't so much that
we thought for is bad or some other

623 
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.000
word choices it's just that we were
sitting there watching children

624 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.000
like you know they're fourteen they
barely know how to use the computer

625 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.000
they're just learning programming for
the first time and they're like

626 
00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:53.000
four left perrin into i and they're
like, i have no idea what this is

627 
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.000
trying to tell me and i just made it
obvious me like i wonder what other

628 
00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.000
words you could use

629 
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.000
maybe we can look it up but when we
looked up information the literature

630 
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.000
there wasn't any evidence of these
things so we decided let's get some

631 
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.000
ourself so we started running like
surveys and we started writing him at

632 
00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.000
at larger scale we started running

633 
00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.000
statistical experiments comparing
competing design choices for syntax and

634 
00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.000
i mean i'm sure it's not that
surprising but a lot of times you can

635 
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:23.000
make stuff both orderly more
understandable and more readable by

636 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:26.000
using common sense terminology and
getting rid of certain kinds of tokens

637 
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:31.000
that you use the scientific method to
derive so for example a lupin quorum is

638 
00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.000
repeat ten times

639 
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:38.000
so that the parameter in a sense that
then is in the middle of keywords right

640 
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:40.000
which might be slightly

641 
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.000
unexpected for people that i used to
auto

642 
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.000
correct but there's also other options
i think there's repeat while and that

643 
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:51.000
works just like a while but the key
though is that you need that were

644 
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.000
repeat because that's a hint toe a
novice that that's what that does

645 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:58.000
semantically so for example the word
repeat implies the concept of

646 
00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.000
federation so when you look at the
statistics for how novices use those

647 
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.000
tools if that words missing it's a
problem so one of the changes i

648 
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.000
understand it correctly that you made
your programming languages quorum is

649 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.000
the synth tax has to be such that words

650 
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:21.000
signifying meaning rather than being
weird words like four right and also a

651 
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.000
lot of the punctuation has to be vetted.
And the funny thing with those

652 
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:28.000
punctuation results is that something
that sometimes they're kind of odd so

653 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.000
like, for example,

654 
00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.000
uh, this one surprise me

655 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.000
if you look at if statements and you
pull out the statistics for if

656 
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:34.000
statements

657 
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.000
java or many languages use parentheses
on the sides and it turns out those are

658 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:46.000
likely to get screwed up, however you
you also get need to get rid of the

659 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:49.000
left brace, but not the right one,
which is sort of a bizarre decision.

660 
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.000
So in corum you haven't if and then you
have an expression and then the word

661 
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:53.000
end

662 
00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:58.000
so and it sounds sort of bizarre, but
if you leave that left one in, it turns

663 
00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:01.000
out that the statistical probability of
novices getting that one correct are

664 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.000
pretty low,

665 
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.000
so you pull it out and everything's
fine.

666 
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:08.000
So instead of if open brackets
something something close bracket you

667 
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.000
have if and then the conditions

668 
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:16.000
and then end, right, and then the other
weird decision, but it turns out to be

669 
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.000
pretty impactful is a few test you have
this question of, should i use the

670 
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.000
double equal sign or a single equals or
triple equals or something like that?

671 
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.000
And it turns out that answer is has a
surprisingly large effect size, so, for

672 
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.000
example if i use a programming language
like

673 
00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:36.000
java, perl, stuff like that and i
compare, use a double equal sign if i

674 
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.000
use a single equal, even

675 
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
if i use the same symbol for assignment
increases the probability of getting

676 
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.000
that token correct by eightfold

677 
00:40:43.386 --> 00:40:47.000
so it's way better to have let me
summarize that an equal sign for

678 
00:40:47.736 --> 00:40:48.000
assignments,

679 
00:40:49.096 --> 00:40:50.000
and also for comparison,

680 
00:40:51.256 --> 00:40:55.000
oddly enough, we've we have designed
test cases where we used them both

681 
00:40:55.016 --> 00:40:58.000
right next to each other, to try to
trick offices up, because the way we're

682 
00:40:58.426 --> 00:41:02.000
thinking, if we're gonna overload it,
that's got a fella p up, turns out not,

683 
00:41:02.616 --> 00:41:06.000
and is this just for blankets or for
all the cans, everybody, it used to be

684 
00:41:06.636 --> 00:41:09.000
in corum that, like we were, we just
started with blind children, but now i

685 
00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:14.000
think it's something like thirty six
thousand kids a year ballpark, so a lot

686 
00:41:14.536 --> 00:41:18.000
more than we would have expected, so so
that road considerations fur sin,

687 
00:41:18.426 --> 00:41:22.000
thanks how to make syntax more
inclusive, so that if you read it, it

688 
00:41:22.566 --> 00:41:27.000
is easier to read, but also for other
kids is more inclusive. Does your

689 
00:41:27.606 --> 00:41:32.000
programming environment also have? Are
you like features to specifically

690 
00:41:32.576 --> 00:41:36.000
support blankets that other ideas your
programming tools don't have? Yes, so

691 
00:41:36.806 --> 00:41:41.000
we've change the various features that
we have for the blind overtime so but

692 
00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:45.000
some of them include additional
navigation features that we build into

693 
00:41:45.366 --> 00:41:46.000
navigators and stuff like that

694 
00:41:47.096 --> 00:41:52.000
we have a self voicing option so sort
of funny because screenwriters

695 
00:41:52.416 --> 00:41:54.000
sometimes break on certain platforms
which is

696 
00:41:55.276 --> 00:41:56.000
stinky but reality

697 
00:41:57.176 --> 00:42:01.000
one of the things that we allow people
to do in our ideas basically turn off

698 
00:42:01.456 --> 00:42:05.000
the default accessibility support turn
on just a different speech engine which

699 
00:42:05.796 --> 00:42:10.000
people don't like a cz much however it
works everywhere and it's virtually

700 
00:42:10.086 --> 00:42:13.000
guaranteed toe actually talk and that
speech engine is inside of your

701 
00:42:13.946 --> 00:42:15.000
programming platform pretty much yeah

702 
00:42:16.016 --> 00:42:19.000
and it's not you know so this is a
thing oftentimes with accessibility if

703 
00:42:19.816 --> 00:42:23.000
you get to eighty percent and it
actually works it's enough so in our

704 
00:42:23.396 --> 00:42:23.000
case

705 
00:42:24.026 --> 00:42:27.000
even though the tools that we had
weren't really perfect at the same time

706 
00:42:27.126 --> 00:42:30.000
was enough to bring the number of
schools for the blind in united states

707 
00:42:31.116 --> 00:42:35.000
that were teaching programming from
basically zero toe about half wow, that

708 
00:42:35.216 --> 00:42:35.000
is impressive.

709 
00:42:36.826 --> 00:42:40.000
So what are some features that you
consider to put into coram but didn't

710 
00:42:40.826 --> 00:42:42.000
make the cut and for what reasons

711 
00:42:43.066 --> 00:42:46.000
in terms of like language features or
heidi features or

712 
00:42:47.114 --> 00:42:50.000
things that maybe if we're programming
we think oh, this is a good idea and

713 
00:42:50.614 --> 00:42:51.000
you tried it and it didn't work

714 
00:42:52.264 --> 00:42:57.000
we want to hear about those okay sure
so if you we do a lot of experiments

715 
00:42:57.464 --> 00:43:00.000
because normally form, we call it
evidence based on all that really means

716 
00:43:00.824 --> 00:43:04.000
is that before we change the syntax and
semantics to the language and force

717 
00:43:04.444 --> 00:43:08.000
every developer using it for every kid
using it to relearn it, we like we run

718 
00:43:08.594 --> 00:43:10.000
a test and the test is usually

719 
00:43:11.244 --> 00:43:14.000
put people in a room have two people
tried or fifty people tried one hundred

720 
00:43:14.664 --> 00:43:18.000
people try it and see what happens. If
it turns out people do pretty well,

721 
00:43:18.254 --> 00:43:21.000
then it can go in the language, and if
it turns out people don't do very well,

722 
00:43:21.594 --> 00:43:25.000
then we kind of let it fall by the
wayside, so we tried a bunch of these

723 
00:43:25.514 --> 00:43:29.000
the one that's, the most common that
has made it that is both in cornerman

724 
00:43:29.344 --> 00:43:32.000
has the strongest evidentiary support
for it is static type icc

725 
00:43:33.134 --> 00:43:35.000
sounds like a silly thing it's, not
like form, is the only language that

726 
00:43:35.604 --> 00:43:38.000
has it, but the evidence is extremely
clear

727 
00:43:39.244 --> 00:43:42.000
that static typing makes developers
more productive. If you're using a

728 
00:43:42.444 --> 00:43:46.000
dynamically language, what happens is,
as you go to call a function,

729 
00:43:46.654 --> 00:43:50.000
oftentimes developers don't know what
to pass to the function, so they go

730 
00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:54.000
hunting for it, and it turns out in
experiments that amount of time where

731 
00:43:54.074 --> 00:43:56.000
they're off hunting for what to pass to
a dynamically type function.

732 
00:43:57.174 --> 00:44:00.000
Matches the time differences in the
studies which means basically

733 
00:44:00.614 --> 00:44:05.000
observation aly we have evidence that
dynamic typing makes perf programmers

734 
00:44:05.264 --> 00:44:09.000
slower than static typing this and this
is for sided developers but i can

735 
00:44:09.794 --> 00:44:13.000
imagine the effect might be even bigger
for blind developers because navigation

736 
00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:18.000
is such a babe big issue because for us
just scrolling to function is just that

737 
00:44:18.854 --> 00:44:23.000
just screwing but if you're a blanket
or blind professional developer the

738 
00:44:23.084 --> 00:44:26.000
navigation is is so big of a hurdle
it's even

739 
00:44:27.154 --> 00:44:30.000
worse i can imagine i've actually never
tested it with professional blind

740 
00:44:30.504 --> 00:44:34.000
developers but i would be very
surprised if you were wrong i think

741 
00:44:34.014 --> 00:44:39.000
you're right so this is a nice example
off something that is useful for

742 
00:44:39.224 --> 00:44:43.000
everyone no just making it inclusive
for like developers but it's better for

743 
00:44:43.904 --> 00:44:44.000
everyone so

744 
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
against the language yeah i think so i
think it goes both ways there's there's

745 
00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.000
one other that maybe maybe your
listeners will be interested so the c

746 
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.000
plus plus standard a few years back
added lambda is to the specifications

747 
00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:01.000
and we were curious whether or not that
had a positive or negative impact so we

748 
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:05.000
ran an empirical study in just
comparing c plus plus lando's to it

749 
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:05.000
aerators

750 
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
which is not the only test you would
need to make a determination but its

751 
00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.000
starting point oh it was also what
apparently the spect writers in the

752 
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.000
original white paper claimed it was for
two hundred plays its traitors

753 
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.000
apparently so way ran a test

754 
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.000
and we compared freshman in college

755 
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
sophomores, juniors, seniors and then
professional developers that we

756 
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.000
recruited from experts in lamb jas

757 
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:34.000
and we found that the experts had no
benefit at all and it basically crushed

758 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:38.000
all of the novices so it's one of these
weird features where you know

759 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.000
developers put something in the
language and maybe it has a benefit but

760 
00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:47.000
we found no evidence to that this is
interesting because people say, oh, i

761 
00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.000
like it because it has land us i mean i
would say that i shall it so nice is

762 
00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:50.000
that

763 
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:52.000
but you're saying

764 
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:59.000
if we measure if it helps it doesn't
help professionals and it herds kid's a

765 
00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:03.000
novice is under the conditions of the
test that we ran yes and i don't think

766 
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
that land is versus it aerators is sort
of the end of the story however

767 
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.000
we did sort of just take it from what
the developers said so it's a starting

768 
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.000
point but it's possible there's other
weird situations where it might help

769 
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.000
like event driven programming your
database or something

770 
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.000
but those need to be verified through
the scientific method to see if that's

771 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000
actually true

772 
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.000
and i think you also mentioned before
not in the show but when we were

773 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:28.000
training before that land does are
specifically hard to be pronounced by

774 
00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:32.000
screen reader because the order is so
different from an incinerator

775 
00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.000
oh, i don't remember saying that, but
actually, that does make sense, it's

776 
00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:40.000
very plausible and there's sort of a
weird, wacky syntax and has a wacky

777 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:44.000
scene. Yeah, and sometimes with that
wacky syntax, believe or not, this

778 
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.000
especially hard for blind children,

779 
00:46:46.075 --> 00:46:49.000
screeners don't always read literally,
so they skipped characters.

780 
00:46:50.045 --> 00:46:53.000
What do they skip? It seems horrible,
all sorts of stuff, and when you think

781 
00:46:53.645 --> 00:46:57.000
about it, that makes sense for, like
microsoft word, because you don't want

782 
00:46:57.005 --> 00:47:01.000
a reading every period that would drive
you insane. So basically, what some

783 
00:47:01.175 --> 00:47:04.000
blind farmers do is they turn on these
verbosity modes to make sure they hear

784 
00:47:04.055 --> 00:47:07.000
everything, but if you're blind and
you're just starting out, you don't

785 
00:47:07.275 --> 00:47:10.000
even know these things exist likely,
and if you have to turn on reading

786 
00:47:10.905 --> 00:47:14.000
every character that it gets back to
annoying again. So it's sort of like

787 
00:47:14.215 --> 00:47:18.000
this unfortunate sort of weird middle
ground with syntax where it's like

788 
00:47:19.065 --> 00:47:22.000
you could do it, but it gets in the way.
Yeah, because some programming that was

789 
00:47:22.835 --> 00:47:27.000
have adults for list access, and that
would be annoying if you would be skips.

790 
00:47:27.685 --> 00:47:32.000
I think so. Do you also take that into
account in this insects of cora? So you

791 
00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:35.000
you were like, oh, lesson old used old
speakers scream readers could but don't

792 
00:47:35.865 --> 00:47:36.000
skip oh

793 
00:47:37.555 --> 00:47:37.000
calm

794 
00:47:38.175 --> 00:47:43.000
actually no because we control the
speech pipeline separately were very

795 
00:47:43.085 --> 00:47:46.000
judicious about what characters the
screenwriter says because we control it

796 
00:47:46.395 --> 00:47:46.000
yeah, but

797 
00:47:47.095 --> 00:47:50.000
i think you mentioned before that
sometimes they use quorum with their

798 
00:47:50.585 --> 00:47:54.000
bill in screen reader and then maybe
yeah, we cheat there too okay? Cheat

799 
00:47:54.855 --> 00:47:59.000
yeah, you overwrite it basically
although we don't actually use dots to

800 
00:47:59.775 --> 00:48:03.000
sort of one of the weird quirky things
about form syntax that came from data

801 
00:48:03.095 --> 00:48:04.000
but my only annoys me

802 
00:48:05.355 --> 00:48:07.000
we found evidence that

803 
00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:12.000
the dot operator isn't the operator you
should use for objects for whatever

804 
00:48:12.555 --> 00:48:16.000
reason surveys on it at scale show the
colon operator makes more sense to

805 
00:48:16.755 --> 00:48:21.000
human beings sort of drove me crazy
enough that i ran a replication study

806 
00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:24.000
at a different university in a
different part of the country just to

807 
00:48:24.435 --> 00:48:27.000
try to prove it wrong, but
unfortunately it replicated with

808 
00:48:27.015 --> 00:48:30.000
tremendous precision. So you're saying
we shouldn't use dole's for object

809 
00:48:30.885 --> 00:48:32.000
access oddly, which

810 
00:48:33.005 --> 00:48:38.000
everyone does yes almost it's annoying
but one's aaron very good no, i've

811 
00:48:38.195 --> 00:48:41.000
never seen it. In fact, we kind of put
it in there is a junk character we

812 
00:48:41.025 --> 00:48:44.000
didn't think would win the study, but
you know, i don't get to choose these

813 
00:48:44.005 --> 00:48:46.000
things that's interesting sort of
bizarre

814 
00:48:47.277 --> 00:48:51.000
i'm not even exactly i have a guess,
but i'm not entirely sure i even

815 
00:48:51.587 --> 00:48:55.000
observe that result like for example,
maybe dot just implies like the end of

816 
00:48:55.147 --> 00:48:59.000
a sentence or something or maybe colin
implies some kind of connected listers

817 
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:00.000
i'm not really sure

818 
00:49:01.007 --> 00:49:04.000
but you know we did it we got the
answer we replicated it got the same

819 
00:49:04.817 --> 00:49:06.000
answer me whales do you d'oh
interesting

820 
00:49:07.187 --> 00:49:11.000
okay, but the fact that the readers
read a character or or don't read

821 
00:49:11.347 --> 00:49:15.000
character isn't what influence the
syntax everything you put into forum is

822 
00:49:15.327 --> 00:49:19.000
there because you tried it with people
and you measured a result not for

823 
00:49:19.277 --> 00:49:22.000
everything. When we first started the
project, we were just working with kids

824 
00:49:22.597 --> 00:49:26.000
and so think about it like this the
very first version of corn we made a

825 
00:49:26.437 --> 00:49:30.000
bunch of decisions and not all of them
were evidence based because that didn't

826 
00:49:30.247 --> 00:49:34.000
exist it wasn't beginning exactly and
there was no such thing as an evidence

827 
00:49:34.177 --> 00:49:36.000
oriented language that that did not
exist, so

828 
00:49:37.017 --> 00:49:40.000
but we found we figured out really
quickly that we needed some evidence

829 
00:49:40.807 --> 00:49:41.000
tto make it better.

830 
00:49:42.107 --> 00:49:45.000
So then what we did is every time we
made a change to the language, we

831 
00:49:45.777 --> 00:49:49.000
started adjusting it over time, but
there are a few decisions and corum

832 
00:49:49.497 --> 00:49:52.000
that air left that we haven't run a
study on yet that i think probably get

833 
00:49:52.597 --> 00:49:57.000
invalidated hope one of them is we have
this sort of wacky multiple inheritance

834 
00:49:57.137 --> 00:50:00.000
system it's not like c plus plus is
it's sort of it's this own thing

835 
00:50:01.117 --> 00:50:04.000
but it would not surprise me if some
day we get a study together that it

836 
00:50:04.787 --> 00:50:08.000
could be invalidated but we try to do
that that's sort of our goal is to sow

837 
00:50:08.607 --> 00:50:13.000
is to run tests to invalidate our own
choices to make them better over time

838 
00:50:13.707 --> 00:50:21.000
so an interesting question there is
ardor cool flits or tension between the

839 
00:50:21.067 --> 00:50:25.000
use for a programming language for
blind professional developers to use

840 
00:50:25.877 --> 00:50:33.000
for learning blind in offices or cited
in offices or learning adult developers

841 
00:50:33.387 --> 00:50:36.000
mean you say we tested it on people

842 
00:50:37.217 --> 00:50:42.000
maybe some features are really great
for professional developers that

843 
00:50:42.257 --> 00:50:45.000
shouldn't be in the language foreign
offices i mean this is a little bit

844 
00:50:45.307 --> 00:50:49.000
like that example you gave land us for
experts they don't matter before kids

845 
00:50:49.299 --> 00:50:54.000
they really matter so are you arguing
for one language that's perfect for

846 
00:50:54.869 --> 00:50:55.000
everyone or

847 
00:50:56.229 --> 00:51:00.000
to do taylor a language that
specifically for blind no emphasis and

848 
00:51:00.669 --> 00:51:04.000
another language that has land lies and
all the bells and whistles for

849 
00:51:04.129 --> 00:51:08.000
professionals what is best there? I
think that that's a great question and

850 
00:51:08.059 --> 00:51:11.000
i think that even the academic
community doesn't really know and

851 
00:51:11.389 --> 00:51:16.000
there's a really good reason it turns
out that between like the fifties until

852 
00:51:16.229 --> 00:51:20.000
about two thousand twelve if you take a
reasonable chunk of the academic

853 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:24.000
literature in computer science on
programming languages they didn't

854 
00:51:24.079 --> 00:51:27.000
actually test with people so we don't
have a consensus, and i say they didn't

855 
00:51:27.489 --> 00:51:33.000
test, i mean, almost overwhelmingly,
universally did not test specifically

856 
00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:39.000
there's, a scholar by the name of anti
hani donahoe, and he discovered that

857 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:43.000
during that period on ly, about twenty
two controlled experiments were

858 
00:51:43.139 --> 00:51:44.000
conducted, and the thing is

859 
00:51:45.209 --> 00:51:47.000
that's just not enough for us to really
know.

860 
00:51:48.329 --> 00:51:52.000
Now, to be more of a more direct answer,
we do have evidence, like you say,

861 
00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:55.000
though, that there are some features
that might be in conflict between

862 
00:51:55.699 --> 00:51:56.000
novices, um, professionals,

863 
00:51:57.059 --> 00:51:58.000
one of them is, again static typing.

864 
00:51:59.339 --> 00:52:02.000
It turns out most of the studies and
replications that we've done or

865 
00:52:02.359 --> 00:52:03.000
somewhere in the ballpark of, like

866 
00:52:04.049 --> 00:52:07.000
yours, three of an academic program up
through, like beginning professional,

867 
00:52:07.909 --> 00:52:11.000
so we don't really have much good
information passed that, and we don't

868 
00:52:11.399 --> 00:52:14.000
have much good information about, like
children or children with disabilities

869 
00:52:14.929 --> 00:52:18.000
or children with, you know, men, women,
all these different kinds of groups,

870 
00:52:18.949 --> 00:52:20.000
and i think if we really want to flesh
out

871 
00:52:21.189 --> 00:52:24.000
whether or not we can make languages
that find a good middle ground for

872 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:28.000
everybody, we're going to be a heck of
a lot more data from but not just for

873 
00:52:28.269 --> 00:52:31.000
me from like, on entire academic
community, otherwise we probably won't

874 
00:52:31.489 --> 00:52:31.000
get there.

875 
00:52:32.859 --> 00:52:35.000
Yes so in general would you say that
not just for our

876 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:40.000
language let's zoom out a bit again so
tools aps websites and programming

877 
00:52:40.859 --> 00:52:45.000
environments should they have a
specific version for the visually

878 
00:52:45.319 --> 00:52:49.000
impaired on a special version for
sighted people like you have an english

879 
00:52:49.539 --> 00:52:50.000
version in the spanish version

880 
00:52:51.282 --> 00:52:54.000
and you get the medicine the same with
all these programmers should there be

881 
00:52:54.322 --> 00:52:57.000
an office programming experience and
something val producers or should it

882 
00:52:57.972 --> 00:52:58.000
will be the same

883 
00:52:59.202 --> 00:53:01.000
what is your take on that specialize or
generalized

884 
00:53:02.062 --> 00:53:05.000
my vote is for generalized and you know
i don't have a crystal ball so i can't

885 
00:53:05.712 --> 00:53:09.000
know for sure but here's my reasoning
when it comes to the first question

886 
00:53:09.482 --> 00:53:11.000
which is specialized for the blind or
not

887 
00:53:12.102 --> 00:53:13.000
that one i would give a hard no

888 
00:53:14.182 --> 00:53:17.000
and the reason is because sometimes
when there's tools that are developed

889 
00:53:17.612 --> 00:53:19.000
just for the blind they don't get
maintained as well

890 
00:53:20.092 --> 00:53:23.000
because you know a company might make
more money off the one that's general

891 
00:53:23.362 --> 00:53:27.000
purpose than not so that's one reason
why at least i don't know how it is

892 
00:53:27.382 --> 00:53:30.000
where you're from but in the united
states well that's one reason why they

893 
00:53:30.582 --> 00:53:33.000
make laws about making general
technology accessible because they

894 
00:53:33.682 --> 00:53:35.000
don't want like amazon to make like the

895 
00:53:36.362 --> 00:53:40.000
blind reader that they maintain once
and then don't support for fifty years

896 
00:53:40.702 --> 00:53:40.000
yeah

897 
00:53:41.092 --> 00:53:45.000
yeah okay you but that is a practical
argument or maybe a capitalist

898 
00:53:45.782 --> 00:53:51.000
arguments it's not a philosophical
argument about what is past talk about

899 
00:53:51.702 --> 00:53:55.000
no dural as it is now, but the world i
was we will i'd like it to be do you

900 
00:53:55.392 --> 00:53:55.000
think

901 
00:53:56.002 --> 00:54:01.000
a specific app for your website for
visually impaired that maybe mrs um

902 
00:54:01.212 --> 00:54:05.000
features that's? Why did developers
would like is that better journals

903 
00:54:05.402 --> 00:54:09.000
suppose we have the money to maintain
when everyone okay, that's a fair point?

904 
00:54:09.942 --> 00:54:12.000
I i still think i prefer the generalist,
though,

905 
00:54:13.652 --> 00:54:18.000
and the reason is because a lot of the
type of stuff that i was taken i d that

906 
00:54:18.252 --> 00:54:21.000
i d does are things like buttons and
lists and trees and stuff, and those

907 
00:54:21.702 --> 00:54:23.000
were actually pretty accessible if it's
there.

908 
00:54:24.052 --> 00:54:28.000
So i do think that you can make
specialized features in ieds that would

909 
00:54:28.042 --> 00:54:29.000
be accessible. That would be better,
though,

910 
00:54:30.032 --> 00:54:34.000
so for example, i do suspect you'd want
to specialize the bugger because right

911 
00:54:34.312 --> 00:54:37.000
now most debugging technologies don't
talk and there are known

912 
00:54:38.072 --> 00:54:41.000
i've invented some talking to buggers
over the years. How cool yeah, they're

913 
00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:44.000
they're pretty fun, they like tell you
like what variables were doing and

914 
00:54:44.382 --> 00:54:44.000
stuff like that

915 
00:54:45.002 --> 00:54:45.000
they're pretty neat

916 
00:54:46.102 --> 00:54:49.000
the current version that we have the
attacking the buggers not great, but

917 
00:54:49.122 --> 00:54:51.000
i'm hoping to build some new ones in
the some new projects and

918 
00:54:52.012 --> 00:54:56.000
so i'm still curious about that talking
the bugger how does it work and why

919 
00:54:56.396 --> 00:54:59.000
isn't that great? But what are you
going to add that s oh it's a little

920 
00:54:59.756 --> 00:55:02.000
bit harder to build it on top of, like
the j v m, javascript and other

921 
00:55:02.926 --> 00:55:06.000
languages, which is what cornum
compiles to a bunch of different places.

922 
00:55:06.916 --> 00:55:11.000
So during my dissertation, working like
the mid to thousands or so which makes

923 
00:55:11.266 --> 00:55:17.000
me feel old now, okay, way had, like an
interpreted version of sea that were

924 
00:55:17.496 --> 00:55:21.000
playing around with and if you contract
information about the state of a

925 
00:55:21.236 --> 00:55:24.000
program and a little bit better way,
you could make the buggers say all

926 
00:55:24.466 --> 00:55:27.000
sorts of cool stuff, like saying what
kind of methods are being called as you

927 
00:55:27.246 --> 00:55:31.000
navigate instead of, like what line
you're on, say, oh, hey, the variable a

928 
00:55:31.196 --> 00:55:35.000
was set to five, and so you could give
people context about what's changing in

929 
00:55:35.426 --> 00:55:35.000
a program.

930 
00:55:36.396 --> 00:55:39.000
Of course, the challenges are like,
what context you give? Yeah,

931 
00:55:40.176 --> 00:55:45.000
so let's ask it probably does so the
stuff that we did was relatively

932 
00:55:45.356 --> 00:55:48.000
primitive. We would just kind of tell
you the most obvious thing like, hey,

933 
00:55:48.186 --> 00:55:52.000
this method was called or hey, this
variable changed, but nonetheless, even

934 
00:55:52.176 --> 00:55:56.000
with just those changes, the studies
that we ran were pretty obviously clear

935 
00:55:56.596 --> 00:55:59.000
that is better than saying you're
online five, you know which is kind of

936 
00:55:59.806 --> 00:56:04.000
obvious but nonetheless like simple
little things can sometimes make a big

937 
00:56:04.036 --> 00:56:07.000
difference for accessibility, but and
they're just not enquire meant this

938 
00:56:07.486 --> 00:56:10.000
point for technical reasons and all
because you don't believe they work

939 
00:56:10.516 --> 00:56:13.000
well the second the butter yes, they
kind of go in and out with every

940 
00:56:13.516 --> 00:56:18.000
releases we experiment so sometimes way
are building a new versions will pull

941 
00:56:18.246 --> 00:56:21.000
something out for a while and are the
bugger right now is okay, but it's

942 
00:56:21.076 --> 00:56:25.000
nothing super special, so i can imagine
these type of features like

943 
00:56:26.376 --> 00:56:31.000
at the burger that talks aren't just
useful for visually impaired people but

944 
00:56:31.496 --> 00:56:36.000
also for sighted people. Can you give a
few examples off accessibility features

945 
00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:41.000
in general not just in ideas but also
an absolute websites that are designed

946 
00:56:41.846 --> 00:56:45.000
for visually impaired people but also
can be useful for sighted people?

947 
00:56:46.676 --> 00:56:50.000
I think i might have already mentioned
this one, but probably the most obvious

948 
00:56:50.056 --> 00:56:51.000
and easy to understand one is

949 
00:56:52.056 --> 00:56:53.000
color contrast moves yeah,

950 
00:56:54.006 --> 00:56:54.000
yeah, yeah,

951 
00:56:55.342 --> 00:57:00.000
okay, so ah lot of the times the
features that people use with

952 
00:57:00.172 --> 00:57:04.000
accessibility can actually also be used
by people without disabilities and one

953 
00:57:04.802 --> 00:57:08.000
obvious one that that blind people use
heavily and so decided people is

954 
00:57:08.922 --> 00:57:09.000
keyboard shortcuts

955 
00:57:10.052 --> 00:57:10.000
and think about it

956 
00:57:11.262 --> 00:57:13.000
some about some of the people that i've
known over the years that are blind

957 
00:57:13.592 --> 00:57:18.000
don't have a monitor or a mouse way
needed by what they needed exactly and

958 
00:57:18.812 --> 00:57:22.000
so, like you generally navigate like
crazy with the keyboard so if you're

959 
00:57:22.302 --> 00:57:26.000
writing an app and you make tons of
awesome keyboard shortcuts and waste a

960 
00:57:26.022 --> 00:57:28.000
knave a grant around of the keyboard
and you're an expert users you'll

961 
00:57:28.972 --> 00:57:31.000
probably like that anyway but blind
people will love you forever

962 
00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:35.000
yes it's some features you met me you
might make that you might even make

963 
00:57:35.982 --> 00:57:38.000
them for expert usual sure like yeah,
all the shortcuts

964 
00:57:39.112 --> 00:57:42.000
and then they're useful for blind
people but also the other way right?

965 
00:57:42.272 --> 00:57:45.000
Yeah exactly or just make him for you
because like you might love those

966 
00:57:45.302 --> 00:57:49.000
things and have them extra and then
blind are crazy about keeper shirt yeah

967 
00:57:49.522 --> 00:57:51.000
that's the thing right including myself
so

968 
00:57:52.752 --> 00:57:56.000
i'm most curious in the other way
around are their accessibility features

969 
00:57:56.472 --> 00:58:01.000
that you can put into a tool a rupture
your app that might hamper so your

970 
00:58:01.682 --> 00:58:06.000
people that we sighted people would be
like ways that there that is confusing

971 
00:58:06.152 --> 00:58:09.000
me it's not helpful? Is that a thing or
is that not?

972 
00:58:10.292 --> 00:58:14.000
Um yeah, probably i mean the you know
it's really easy is a developer to make

973 
00:58:14.982 --> 00:58:18.000
a boo boo and make something hard to
understand so a lot of the same things

974 
00:58:18.462 --> 00:58:18.000
like

975 
00:58:19.242 --> 00:58:23.000
you know if you're content is written
in a funny way or your interface

976 
00:58:24.342 --> 00:58:30.000
has weird color contrasts in it or the
buttons air aligned in strange ways or

977 
00:58:30.582 --> 00:58:34.000
ah good one might be tab order like for
a sighted person that's using the

978 
00:58:34.652 --> 00:58:37.000
keyboard shortcuts that they have weird
tab orders so that you're flying around

979 
00:58:37.652 --> 00:58:38.000
the interface in a funny way

980 
00:58:39.302 --> 00:58:41.000
for a sighted person that's going to be
odd, you know, like

981 
00:58:42.042 --> 00:58:46.000
imagine like a form where it jumps to
the wrong spots as you press tab right

982 
00:58:46.032 --> 00:58:50.000
for you and i that because i'm a
sighted person too. That would be

983 
00:58:50.182 --> 00:58:56.000
really annoying for a blind person who
drive them bonkers. So so we can be xer

984 
00:58:56.012 --> 00:58:56.000
debated by

985 
00:58:57.242 --> 00:59:01.000
no being able to see exactly cool.
Those are all things we can take into

986 
00:59:01.702 --> 00:59:06.000
going toe when making stuff for blind
people but also making it accessible

987 
00:59:06.482 --> 00:59:10.000
for other people. That was everything i
wanted to ask. Is there anything you

988 
00:59:10.772 --> 00:59:12.000
want to add anything we missed?

989 
00:59:13.142 --> 00:59:17.000
No, i think that you have a lot of
questions that i appreciate a whole lot

990 
00:59:17.722 --> 00:59:19.000
of made me actually think about it
who's

991 
00:59:20.042 --> 00:59:24.000
gonna want to make our guests thing to
make her audience. I think we just want

992 
00:59:24.002 --> 00:59:27.000
to ask you one more thing if that's
okay, if we want to know more about you,

993 
00:59:27.542 --> 00:59:30.000
your programming language, the cool
stuff you're doing, what is your

994 
00:59:30.712 --> 00:59:31.000
website when we re more about

995 
00:59:32.002 --> 00:59:35.000
you well, i think in google, andrea
steph iq and my

996 
00:59:36.062 --> 00:59:39.000
university website is up and i'll send
you a link, but if you want to read

997 
00:59:39.402 --> 00:59:42.000
more about forum, you go to korean
language dot com,

998 
00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:45.000
you want to read more about evidence,
there's a nice little link right on the

999 
00:59:45.772 --> 00:59:49.000
fun, and it'll give you a bunch of
little details about how this evidence

1000 
00:59:49.232 --> 00:59:52.000
thing kind of works cool. We'll make
sure all of those are in the show

1001

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.000
computer shines at the university of
nevada las vegas andreas has been

7 
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.000
working on creating technologies that
make it easier for people including

8 
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.000
those with disabilities to write
computer software he helped establish

9 
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.000
the first national educational
infrastructure for blind or visually

10 
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.000
impaired students to learn computer
shines and he's also the inventor of

11 
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.000
corum the first evidence oriented
programming language and do thus than

12 
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.000
sixteen andres received the white house

13 
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.000
shines education welcome to the show
under yes thanks and thanks for inviting

14 
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
me so this show is about how blind and
visually impaired people interact with

15 
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.000
sulfur but first let's start with the
basics how many blind or visually

16 
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.000
impaired people are there in the world
what should we take into account when

17 
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.000
designing so far for them it's about one
point three million people ball park and

18 
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.000
one in the us and that's a lot of people
it's enough to at least make a dent on

19 
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.000
any kind of mark to market you could
sell for so help us understand how blind

20 
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.000
people using computer because most
people that listen to the show probably

21 
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.000
are sighted outside it is how we call
people like that khun c and they're used

22 
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.000
to using the mouse looking at the screen
what do blind and visually officially

23 
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.000
empower people do there's a variety of
things that they do many people that are

24 
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.000
blind or visually impaired have partial
vision or sometimes called functional

25 
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.000
vision depending on what it is and
usually that means they can see some

26 
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.000
things or they can see color or they can
see some amount of light depending upon

27 
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.000
the person. So in those cases you might
use technologies like screen magnifier

28 
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.000
zor you might use literally a magnifying
glass for other types of things if you

29 
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.000
are non sighted meaning you have no
sight at all or you have no vision

30 
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.000
that's effectively functional than a
more typical devices either braille or a

31 
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.000
screen reader probably the most common
is screen reader technologies and

32 
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.000
basically what it means is that the
computer translates what's on the screen

33 
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.000
into speech can you give us a nim
precious in for how that would look like

34 
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:35.000
so if if a screen reader listens to or
looks at the web page how does that some

35 
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.000
slash luke yeah, i'll turn it on a v h

38 
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.000
screenwriters called voiceover it's the
screening option happens to be on mac on

39 
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.000
windows there's a bunch of them there's
one called nvidia, which is free there's

40 
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.000
one that's made by a company called
freedom scientific called jaws pretty

41 
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.000
popular but quite quite expensive and
windows has one built in a cz well

42 
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.000
that's been improving over the last few
years, so when we listen to it it's not

43 
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.000
only reading the text on the web site it
can also navigate the website and give

44 
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.000
us information on where you are it said
something like you are now x yeah that's

45 
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.000
good so there's a funny thing so
academics often talk about this with a

46 
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.000
certain term they call it the wear at my
problem i think the person that defined

47 
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.000
that was ah a woman by the name of
excuse me, joan friend francioni or

48 
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.000
frankie and i'm not sure i've never met
her actually, but in any case, the idea

49 
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.000
is pretty simple it's that the screen
reader ties to give you both a sense of

50 
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.000
the content and a sense of like where
you are on the page like the semantics

51 
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.000
of web page like i'm in a heading or i'm
in a paragraph or i'm on a level two

52 
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.000
heading stuff like that yeah, because
not only consuming the text is a problem

53 
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.000
navigating is also a big problem i've
understood right? Yeah yes, the

54 
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.000
navigation parts of it are probably the
most crucial because think about it like

55 
00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:08.000
this if i gave you a long website and i
just read the text linearly it would be

56 
00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:13.000
pretty hard to understand because won't
be very long and if you can navigate a

57 
00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:16.000
web page, then you khun selectively
determine what information toe

58 
00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:20.000
understand when and that makes it a lot
easier. So so far we thought about

59 
00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:26.000
websites and navigation but of course
there's also acts and programs do they

60 
00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:30.000
also work with build in screen reader?
Are you ap and program developers have

61 
00:04:30.762 --> 00:04:35.000
to do something special? It's
complicated unfortunately so on the webs

62 
00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:40.000
on the web there's a number of rather
excellent standards for accessibility in

63 
00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:46.000
part just because the webs used a lot s
o to give your listeners on example one

64 
00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:50.000
is called aria aria is basically a way
that you could do interactive web sites

65 
00:04:50.442 --> 00:04:53.000
is sort of the type of thing if you
wanted like an interactive facebook or

66 
00:04:53.382 --> 00:04:58.000
something to be blind, accessible apse
khun definitely be accessible as well,

67 
00:04:58.592 --> 00:05:02.000
but how they're accessible varies by
platform and is actually one of the sort

68 
00:05:02.662 --> 00:05:08.000
of pain points. For example, if i want
to make my app from apple accessible

69 
00:05:08.512 --> 00:05:12.000
there's certain happily type things that
i have to do and they're kind of tricky

70 
00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:17.000
and android has its own platform with
its own languages and ecosystem on top

71 
00:05:17.822 --> 00:05:22.000
of that, if you're using apse on
something like a tablet or phone they

72 
00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:25.000
have different screen reader
technologies so apple has voice over

73 
00:05:25.982 --> 00:05:29.000
which i think most people credit a
scholar named sean kane for inventing

74 
00:05:29.882 --> 00:05:34.000
sort of like really cool gestures that
you use specifically for blind

75 
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:38.000
individuals on dh android sort of has
those too but they kind of have weird

76 
00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:42.000
variations and are complicated can we
talk for a living more about voiceover

77 
00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:47.000
on the iphone because i've seen in an
action but i think our audience might be

78 
00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:51.000
a little bit confused how does that work
with because the on ly interface is the

79 
00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:56.000
scream any aikens how does that work and
how does it work with special gestures?

80 
00:05:56.442 --> 00:06:03.000
Okay, so how to describe it in words so
think about it like this like if i want

81 
00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:08.000
to if i'ma sided user and i'm scrolling
wrong along i might move my finger up

82 
00:06:08.812 --> 00:06:13.000
and down and that would let me see the
content but if i'm blind oftentimes what

83 
00:06:13.642 --> 00:06:18.000
i do is i might tap or tap on parts of
the screen or double tap to interact

84 
00:06:18.562 --> 00:06:24.000
with it and when i do that if i hit a
target it'll talk so the idea is that i

85 
00:06:24.192 --> 00:06:29.000
can use gestures to sort of interact
semantically with the tablet as opposed

86 
00:06:29.252 --> 00:06:33.000
to just scrolling with a finger and
reading it so it would read for example,

87 
00:06:33.102 --> 00:06:37.000
the name of the aps and then if i hear
the ad buy wants, i would step and then

88 
00:06:37.402 --> 00:06:41.000
it would open that yeah, stuff like that
so like my friend, what a friend of mine

89 
00:06:41.642 --> 00:06:45.000
that does uber all the time on his
iphone taps it in a certain way and i

90 
00:06:45.802 --> 00:06:49.000
will give him a sense of where it is on
the map and things like that you could

91 
00:06:49.102 --> 00:06:54.000
actually use a lot of absent so long as
the developer codes it in so let's talk

92 
00:06:54.092 --> 00:06:59.000
about that as long as the developer
codes it in a little bit. So how well

93 
00:06:59.302 --> 00:07:05.000
are we doing at this point? Are most aps
operating systems and websites

94 
00:07:05.082 --> 00:07:10.000
accessible? Our day notes are gay medium
assessable how how well we're doing, i

95 
00:07:10.502 --> 00:07:13.000
don't think i could give you a number in
terms of a percentage, but a feeling for

96 
00:07:13.992 --> 00:07:19.000
me. Yeah, i would say that there are
some companies that do a really great

97 
00:07:19.882 --> 00:07:24.000
job and that those air often somewhat
bigger ones but that we have a really

98 
00:07:24.762 --> 00:07:28.000
long way to go and that's not a
christmas criticism is just on

99 
00:07:28.372 --> 00:07:32.000
observation i mean, oftentimes
developers don't actually get any

100 
00:07:32.102 --> 00:07:35.000
training on building these in school and
it's not reveal so it's not like it's

101 
00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:39.000
not like we have a long way to go
because the technology's air all bad for

102 
00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:43.000
some reason it's just usually don't even
teach this in school all you know,

103 
00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:47.000
developer doesn't learn about thie s
accessible libraries on mac, which are

104 
00:07:47.012 --> 00:07:52.000
the common thing, or if you're on
desktop platforms, microsoft has its own

105 
00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:55.000
libraries, and apple has its own
libraries, and lennox has its own

106 
00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:58.000
libraries, and all of them were
different, and none of them are

107 
00:07:58.172 --> 00:08:03.000
compatible. So personally, i think that
it would be a lot easier for developers

108 
00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:06.000
to develop accessible technology if
there was, like, a unifying standard

109 
00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:11.000
across platforms, but that doesn't
really exist at this stage of the game,

110 
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.000
at least, yeah, that was one of my goals
in inviting you for an episode is to

111 
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.000
make developers more aware and to help
them what they can do to make their so

112 
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.000
far more accessible, which was also my
next question. So what can we do as the

113 
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.000
vespers? What are two things we need to
think about when wanting to make our

114 
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:35.000
acts more accessible? Okay, so the first
thing to do if you design a website is

115 
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.000
that there's a special set of guidelines
from the w three c, and they are

116 
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.000
specifically for accessibility don't
make sure we're linked to those and

117 
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.000
showed no so people can check them out.
Yeah, and those are affected easily the

118 
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.000
most comprehensive source about how to
make a website accessible, and they're

119 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.000
great. They just tell you like, if you
have a link, how you make that

120 
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.000
accessible, what kind of if you have a
picture and obviously you can't see it,

121 
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.000
you put in some kind of all text, right?
And there's there's all sorts of small

122 
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.000
things that you can do there's also some
online accessibility checkers that you

123 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.000
can use a knight and they're not perfect.
You know, they can't tell you that your

124 
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.000
website is easy to use, but sometimes
they can at least give you, like, a

125 
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.000
check and balance for some of the easy
thing like, hey, you forgot your all

126 
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.000
text for that image. You should go fix
that stuff like that. You know what?

127 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.000
What are some of the issues? So all
taxes, i think something people are

128 
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.000
familiar with, even if they don't know
what use it you mentioned links what are

129 
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:37.000
best practices for links that are easy
to fix? Okay, so with links, one thing

130 
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.000
that is generally good is to not give
your link a moniker that doesn't have

131 
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.000
semantic meaning. So, for example, to do
this, go hear the word here should not

132 
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.000
kill link, because then when you get it
through the screen and it is going to

133 
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.000
stop, it is going to say link here. And
you're going to say wares here, so we'll

134 
00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.000
be better is to say, go to the website
for the block and have that whole part b

135 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.000
a link, it sounds like a minor thing,
but the screen reader could make a

136 
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.000
difference. You have to listen to it.
Yeah, that that is relatively easy to

137 
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.000
fix because super so let me understand
how exactly that we're to screen reader,

138 
00:10:12.898 --> 00:10:16.000
if you're navigating, there would be an
option to go through all the links, and

139 
00:10:16.648 --> 00:10:21.000
if there were all labeled here, it will
be here, here, whereas if you would say

140 
00:10:21.058 --> 00:10:26.000
the website of andrea's org website off
university of nevada as a link, you

141 
00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:29.000
could more usually navigate yeah, that's
the kind of idea, like any time that you

142 
00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:33.000
have a structure, give it a semantic
meaning that's exactly right? Yeah, and

143 
00:10:33.248 --> 00:10:37.000
the other things that are relatively
easy to fix, that we should think, yeah,

144 
00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:39.000
eso another one that is kind of an
obvious one. I'll tell you, when this

145 
00:10:39.948 --> 00:10:45.000
sort of adorable my daughter is, like
five, and her school does a great job,

146 
00:10:45.268 --> 00:10:49.000
but they have a couple accessibility
falls on their website that are just

147 
00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:52.000
make maybe laugh a little bit like they
didn't do it intentionally it's ok, and

148 
00:10:52.658 --> 00:10:55.000
so one thing that they did that that
just i thought was funny is they wanted

149 
00:10:55.748 --> 00:10:59.000
to put a schedule online so what they
did is they took a picture of the

150 
00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:03.000
schedule like a complicated spreadsheets
and then they put that onto the website

151 
00:11:04.358 --> 00:11:07.000
and then it shrunk so if you're visually
impaired you can't actually read it

152 
00:11:07.728 --> 00:11:11.000
because the text is to blot it out and
if you have a screen reader you're going

153 
00:11:11.298 --> 00:11:14.000
to get to that thing and it's going to
say image so you can't actually do

154 
00:11:14.938 --> 00:11:19.000
anything so one thing to do is don't
like replace content with already

155 
00:11:19.848 --> 00:11:23.000
accessible things you know if you need
to have a table, put a table in there

156 
00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:28.000
and then give it the market that it
needs from the w three c so images to be

157 
00:11:28.098 --> 00:11:32.000
for making your upside nice here but
they shouldn't be replacing consents

158 
00:11:32.478 --> 00:11:37.000
exactly also have bean represented
sexually that's correct that is actual

159 
00:11:37.018 --> 00:11:43.000
invites so what about a user interface
if we're no no longer talking about a

160 
00:11:43.008 --> 00:11:48.000
website but something that has buttons
and drop down menus scroll bars why we

161 
00:11:48.118 --> 00:11:51.000
do in those so that's a little bit
trickier because it depends on the

162 
00:11:51.108 --> 00:11:56.000
platform and it also depends on the a p
i that you're using so for example, if

163 
00:11:56.808 --> 00:12:00.000
you're using java unfortunately, while
java technically has an accessibility

164 
00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.000
architecture er a lot of it doesn't
really work that well or in some cases

165 
00:12:04.988 --> 00:12:10.000
really at all so this is unfortunate not
because you know it just is but because

166 
00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:13.000
if you're a developer you might be
thinking all right i'm going code to the

167 
00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:16.000
accessibility interface is gonna be
awesome gonna make this totally

168 
00:12:16.642 --> 00:12:20.000
accessible and then you turn it on on a
particular platform and you're like, oh,

169 
00:12:20.562 --> 00:12:24.000
it doesn't work and you can verify that
by turning on the screen which you're

170 
00:12:24.482 --> 00:12:28.000
free often times and so you just flip it
on and say oh, it doesnt make sound i'll

171 
00:12:28.072 --> 00:12:32.000
give an example in the net beans
development environment second two of

172 
00:12:32.362 --> 00:12:37.000
programmers the text editor didn't work
for years so it's like the fundamental

173 
00:12:37.292 --> 00:12:40.000
thing like about how to use a
development environment like writing

174 
00:12:40.972 --> 00:12:45.000
text but it was not accessible what was
wrong with job is accessibility system

175 
00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:51.000
doesn't work wow and it's you know it is
what it is and there are other there are

176 
00:12:51.652 --> 00:12:55.000
other types of environments that are
much more accessible so for example

177 
00:12:56.002 --> 00:13:00.000
microsoft for whatever reason gets flak
a lot but for accessibility they've got

178 
00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:05.000
a pretty dang good job right they ap
eyes worked pretty well they're not

179 
00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:09.000
perfect but there well thought through
over many years and they're compatible

180 
00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:14.000
with a lot of systems is not a plug for
microsoft i've no vested interest but

181 
00:13:14.862 --> 00:13:18.000
they have this thing called i accessible
to and basically if you kowtow

182 
00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:22.000
accessible to then your stuff is almost
certain to be accessible but if you're

183 
00:13:22.312 --> 00:13:25.000
working at sort of a higher level then
sort of the little level old calm type

184 
00:13:25.912 --> 00:13:30.000
stuff and you're just using sheet c
sharp they've done a pretty damn good

185 
00:13:30.172 --> 00:13:34.000
job of like building it in so that
buttons and text boxes and stuff like

186 
00:13:34.382 --> 00:13:39.000
that are mostly accessible night so if
you stick with development tools from

187 
00:13:39.642 --> 00:13:43.000
big platforms usually there are okay,
well, it depends on the platform job is

188 
00:13:43.802 --> 00:13:47.000
pretty big too, but it's debatable
whether it's accessible depending on

189 
00:13:47.772 --> 00:13:52.000
platform where c sharp is at least
pretty dang accessible on windows and

190 
00:13:52.822 --> 00:13:56.000
there's a mac, they do have something
called an s accessible and that does

191 
00:13:56.712 --> 00:14:00.000
work pretty well if you're on ly writing
in the mac go system, the tricky thing

192 
00:14:00.752 --> 00:14:03.000
is, whenever you're using other
programming languages in those

193 
00:14:03.132 --> 00:14:08.000
ecosystems like, for example, is small
talk accessible is python accessible

194 
00:14:08.292 --> 00:14:12.000
it's kind of you have to take it on a
case by case basis because of the

195 
00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:17.000
platform yeah see of those tools but by
from the windows is different from

196 
00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:22.000
biting a mech candy. It depends on what
the dabs implemented. So so there still

197 
00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:26.000
some to some things that we need to know
about nest developers because the

198 
00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:29.000
platforms are going to take care of it?
Yeah, in fact, this is one reason why

199 
00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:32.000
i've cared about the consistency of
programming languages in part because it

200 
00:14:32.969 --> 00:14:37.000
impacts some groups pretty poorly, like
the blind, you know, like i'll give an

201 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:40.000
example are tools for the blind, i think
your written in like, eight programming

202 
00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:44.000
languages and we don't want them to be,
but we have to connect to these

203 
00:14:44.489 --> 00:14:47.000
different systems. There's really no
choice, something like that sixty eight

204 
00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:54.000
i forget a lot a lot here is not of the
books. So what about other things that

205 
00:14:54.349 --> 00:14:57.000
we should take care of? So one of things
that has surprised me a lot in working

206 
00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:02.000
with, like children only a little bit is
that some stuff like working with the

207 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:07.000
mouse takes lots of energy if you're
visually impaired but not entirely blind

208 
00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:11.000
so you can see a little bit, so we
sighted people would think, oh, you can

209 
00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:15.000
use the mouse, but tracing where the
mouse cursor is and using the mouse

210 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:19.000
takes lots of energy that was this thing
that surprised me loans are there are a

211 
00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:23.000
few other things that we like this that
we should think about, yeah, and

212 
00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:26.000
actually there's some stuff that greeted
hui tool kit designers khun do that are

213 
00:15:26.979 --> 00:15:31.000
pretty easy. So for example, if you're
designing some kind of a text box type

214 
00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:34.000
interface and it doesn't have any
textbooks but something that you would

215 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:38.000
follow a pointer whenever the point your
moves, if someone is magnified, follow

216 
00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:42.000
it right so that if you're moving a
magnification system, they always have

217 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:46.000
the context of where the most important
thing is i'm sort of full focus should

218 
00:15:46.609 --> 00:15:51.000
full of occurred are yes ok, yeah so
like if you're like for example, one of

219 
00:15:51.099 --> 00:15:56.000
my old students i shouldn't say his name
since you know, because he happens to be

220 
00:15:56.019 --> 00:16:01.000
blind right? And he used a magnifier
pretty heavily and when he would use

221 
00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:05.000
just typical gooey elements for example,
imagine if you pressed a button and

222 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:09.000
opened a menu, but it didn't jump to
that menu and you're highly magnified

223 
00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:13.000
it's a lot easier if the magnification
system follows you but not all the

224 
00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:16.000
operating systems do that. Oh, and then
you'd have to scroll, which is super

225 
00:16:16.808 --> 00:16:21.000
hard yes magnify yeah, so i clicked the
menu and then have to, like, tap the

226 
00:16:21.018 --> 00:16:24.000
mouse a bunch to sort of get it up there
and hope that you can find it the gets

227 
00:16:24.978 --> 00:16:30.000
tricky so focus is a big issue focuses a
huge issue you rejection, any order,

228 
00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:35.000
huge issues like that let's see so for
in terms of trying to make general user

229 
00:16:35.878 --> 00:16:39.000
interfaces accessible won that my team
has been working on that i think it's

230 
00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:42.000
really fun is we've been trying to
figure out how to make graphics

231 
00:16:42.488 --> 00:16:46.000
accessible, so here here's the tricky
part if you've got something like like

232 
00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:50.000
let's just say unity three d which is
sort of like this game designed platform

233 
00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:53.000
right? We have ah grant from the
national science foundation right now to

234 
00:16:53.878 --> 00:16:57.000
try to take big, complicated three d
interfaces like that make him buy

235 
00:16:57.688 --> 00:17:01.000
accessible but here's the rub well, you
could make buttons and stuff like that

236 
00:17:01.298 --> 00:17:05.000
accessible there's just no way you can
tell open g l make yourself blind

237 
00:17:05.127 --> 00:17:09.000
accessible there just is no tool it is
inherent visual it is inherently visual

238 
00:17:09.518 --> 00:17:13.000
accept any kind of three d application
still has things you could potentially

239 
00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:18.000
tele screen reader about so for example,
if i'm navigating terrain or something

240 
00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:21.000
like that are trying to adjust to rain
or a three d model hypothetically you

241 
00:17:21.738 --> 00:17:25.000
could provide a list of things that
could be positions on that terrain and

242 
00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:28.000
tell it to go up and down which would
still give a screen reader information.

243 
00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:33.000
So one of the things we're trying to
invent in the lab is a way for blind

244 
00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:36.000
children to be able to write their own
three d computer games and be able to

245 
00:17:36.408 --> 00:17:39.000
adjust it through their typical
screening device without needing any

246 
00:17:39.618 --> 00:17:42.000
special stuff while still having it the
hardware accelerated and all that stuff

247 
00:17:43.298 --> 00:17:47.000
it's been a hard project that's taking
me four years to get a handle around in

248 
00:17:47.388 --> 00:17:51.000
my brain but i think we're getting
pretty close and are those things that

249 
00:17:51.308 --> 00:17:56.000
also usable for let's say more practical
things that are inherently visual i'm

250 
00:17:56.628 --> 00:18:01.000
thinking off a diagram or a map or a
graph see that's the thing if you could

251 
00:18:01.898 --> 00:18:05.000
do that for the hard stuff and graphics
any of the rest comes comes easily yeah

252 
00:18:06.848 --> 00:18:10.000
oh yeah we talked about frameworks and
libraries ready a little bit. So you

253 
00:18:10.528 --> 00:18:15.000
mentioned and ass accessible that's a
framework that we can use to make stuff

254 
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:19.000
more accessible? Sort of out of the
books are there are other things we

255 
00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:24.000
should check out frameworks of libraries.
Yeah, the big one's, the big. The two

256 
00:18:24.108 --> 00:18:29.000
biggest ones are anice accessible on mac
and i accessible to on windows. But i

257 
00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:33.000
think since in terms of the web, by far
the two things that people should know

258 
00:18:33.578 --> 00:18:37.000
about the w three c accessibility
standards and also this thing called

259 
00:18:37.138 --> 00:18:42.000
aria this mildly mildly hard to google
sometimes you don't have to say a r i a

260 
00:18:42.638 --> 00:18:48.000
space accessibility, but the idea is
that the w three c standards sort of

261 
00:18:48.848 --> 00:18:52.000
tell you any pretty much anything you
would need to know about basic like

262 
00:18:52.418 --> 00:18:55.000
content. And the aria standards are
really good at trying to help you

263 
00:18:55.988 --> 00:19:00.000
understand like interactive content,
cool or audio up to a jag stuff things

264 
00:19:00.498 --> 00:19:03.000
like that we'll make sure we at all of
that to the show notes so people that

265 
00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:09.000
want to know more comtech it out the
sleeve so so far we've mainly talked

266 
00:19:09.128 --> 00:19:15.000
about to everyday tools that many people
use like a website or an actor or a

267 
00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:21.000
phone but there's also people that
program while blinds and we use the

268 
00:19:21.338 --> 00:19:27.000
vespers might make tools for people that
want a program also more accessible so i

269 
00:19:27.078 --> 00:19:33.000
want to talk about that a little bit how
do blind people program and what should

270 
00:19:33.008 --> 00:19:38.000
we know by blind developers to make
developed tools more assessable yes so

271 
00:19:38.008 --> 00:19:42.000
actually blind developers fall into the
same category so either visually

272 
00:19:42.558 --> 00:19:48.000
impaired or totally blind and they do
amazingly interesting things. So for

273 
00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:52.000
example a number of line developers that
design technologies for all sorts of

274 
00:19:52.168 --> 00:19:56.000
things one of one of my good friends his
name is signor graham he designs

275 
00:19:56.658 --> 00:20:00.000
accessibility installations for museums
he he won this award from the white

276 
00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:03.000
house a bunch of years back and got
connected with museums all over the

277 
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:06.000
world to build like weird, accessible
interfaces and stuff like that if you go

278 
00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:09.000
to your museum there's an accessible
thing it's very likely he's been

279 
00:20:09.928 --> 00:20:13.000
involved in some capacity or another. So
what are we thinking about accessible

280 
00:20:13.418 --> 00:20:17.000
museums then someone that's describing
the painting i could be all sorts of

281 
00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:21.000
stuff and to be honest, i'm not exactly
sure all the details of what he does but

282 
00:20:21.683 --> 00:20:25.000
i've seen like some stuff here and there
it seems pretty cool but the point is as

283 
00:20:26.063 --> 00:20:29.000
the point isn't so much the details of
what he does it's how he does it so how

284 
00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:33.000
does he do it? So what he does is he
uses his screen reader and then he

285 
00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:37.000
listens to the text now there's some
obvious complexity there so for example,

286 
00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:42.000
if you two sided users sometimes as
developers we don't really think about

287 
00:20:42.163 --> 00:20:46.000
the sort of weird wacky syntax that
happens but is a blind developer you

288 
00:20:46.053 --> 00:20:49.000
literally have to listen to for left
brandon cycle zero cynical and i was

289 
00:20:49.423 --> 00:20:53.000
intense public alumni list i suppose
right friend left brace yourself like

290 
00:20:53.203 --> 00:20:57.000
that so it's free reader that's normally
used for text is then used in source

291 
00:20:57.863 --> 00:21:02.000
code and it just reads old symbols yeah
and it's not like you can't get used to

292 
00:21:02.753 --> 00:21:06.000
it but the problem is it depends you
know a lot on like where you are in the

293 
00:21:06.203 --> 00:21:09.000
development pipeline like if you're an
experienced super experienced

294 
00:21:09.073 --> 00:21:12.000
professional you've already made it past
all the barriers and you're good to go

295 
00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:16.000
then yeah, you're going to be fine, but
we've also spent a lot of time talking

296 
00:21:16.673 --> 00:21:20.000
to blind children and let's just say the
first time that a blind child hears for

297 
00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:23.000
left handed like was there a some
clothes i wasn't sent simon cohen on

298 
00:21:23.413 --> 00:21:27.000
post post right prem left grace it's a
little weird and it sort of makes you

299 
00:21:27.043 --> 00:21:34.000
wonder why languages are built that way
for enough so for the let's say end user

300 
00:21:34.803 --> 00:21:39.000
tools we talked about navigation being a
huge issue i can imagine that is for

301 
00:21:39.593 --> 00:21:45.000
programming as well i think if i read
golden and infirm eriks code base i

302 
00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:50.000
would scroll open on to see what other
classes when other methods how does the

303 
00:21:50.093 --> 00:21:54.000
screen reader for blind people navigate
smersh code? Because does it have

304 
00:21:54.263 --> 00:21:57.000
hatters there's a take the contacts into
account or you could skip from the one

305 
00:21:57.823 --> 00:22:03.000
class to the other yes and no so it does
but in the same way you know how when

306 
00:22:03.973 --> 00:22:06.000
you're using a development tool
oftentimes you might have a little like

307 
00:22:06.933 --> 00:22:10.000
navigators off to the side and it'll
have the list of the classes and methods

308 
00:22:10.263 --> 00:22:14.000
you click on him oftentimes those air
accessible so you can still jump around.

309 
00:22:14.383 --> 00:22:19.000
However, that doesn't mean it's easy, so
when you're done, i think one of the

310 
00:22:19.449 --> 00:22:24.000
harder things for blind individuals is
that you can navigate a little bit and

311 
00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:27.000
there's a number of research teams that
are working on making those navigators

312 
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:31.000
better. But the one of the trickier part
of if you've got like a long method,

313 
00:22:31.459 --> 00:22:35.000
getting context can be difficult. So you
know twenty lines of really complicated

314 
00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:39.000
code you have to kind of memorize it to
figure out what's going on depending

315 
00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:43.000
upon what you're doing oh so you're
saying if you want to comprehend and

316 
00:22:43.009 --> 00:22:47.000
methods maybe you read one line read
another line but you need to remember

317 
00:22:47.709 --> 00:22:51.000
all of those whereas if you recited the
fell apart you could skip down to maybe

318 
00:22:51.379 --> 00:22:55.000
the loop that's in the methods and like,
oh, it loops over all the customers are

319 
00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:59.000
whatever that's yeah exactly so like if
i'm looking at a screen of code, i can

320 
00:22:59.399 --> 00:23:03.000
kind of glance up and down to get very
quick context that's a little bit harder

321 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:07.000
if you're blind or i guess many of my
blind friends would probably say that

322 
00:23:07.399 --> 00:23:12.000
it's not this way harder but maybe
slower yeah or different different yeah

323 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:19.000
arter things we can do as developers in
that respect, what can we do to make

324 
00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:23.000
developer tools more accessible? For
example, that navigation can we make

325 
00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:29.000
resource go more easily navigate herbal
for source code it's tough? I think that

326 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:34.000
the bigger issues are number one many of
the development ides aren't very

327 
00:23:34.389 --> 00:23:38.000
accessible or if they are accessible
they sort of break every other release

328 
00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:42.000
and it's again it's not like it's
malicious or anything it's just people

329 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:47.000
don't think about it. So for example
visual studio is sort of accessible

330 
00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:52.000
right now, but historically it's sort of
you know is sort of accessible sort of

331 
00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:57.000
not depending on the release or even if
it is accessible for certain ieds

332 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:24:02.000
sometimes they make rather adorable
decisions, so for example i remember

333 
00:24:02.729 --> 00:24:06.000
boyfriend which version of visual studio
it was but i recall there was a little

334 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:10.000
too bugger label and had an arrow wanted
and so if europe a blind person or like

335 
00:24:10.479 --> 00:24:14.000
let's say a child instead of giving you
information about what you're doing in

336 
00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:18.000
the departure would say like graphic
fifty three and it's like i get it you

337 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:21.000
can learn that but it's sort of weird
you have to write so is that what you

338 
00:24:21.766 --> 00:24:26.000
mean with short of accessible can you
explain a little bit more more detail

339 
00:24:26.146 --> 00:24:30.000
what what does it mean if something is
sword off accessible it was sort off

340 
00:24:30.826 --> 00:24:35.000
what is it and what parts is
inaccessible and what parts isn't it i'm

341 
00:24:35.016 --> 00:24:37.000
trying to think how to describe this
like have you ever been on a website and

342 
00:24:37.656 --> 00:24:44.000
like you could use it but it's sort of
bothered you yeah doesn't fuel logical

343 
00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:49.000
right like the links are on weird places
and it looks strange and stuff like that

344 
00:24:49.296 --> 00:24:55.000
that's true for accessible interface is
a cz well so example if you're a page

345 
00:24:55.256 --> 00:24:58.000
wasn't structured with proper formatting
then you wouldn't be able to navigate

346 
00:24:58.836 --> 00:25:03.000
its you might go to like go up and down
with bunch of giant paragraphs but you

347 
00:25:03.886 --> 00:25:08.000
would definitely be annoyed and with
ideas is kind of a similar situation

348 
00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:11.000
it's sort of like you might be able to
navigate the source code editor but

349 
00:25:11.976 --> 00:25:16.000
maybe navigation doesn't work maybe
certain features are broken maybe you'll

350 
00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:19.000
get to certain windows you can't
navigate through amore the preferences

351 
00:25:19.826 --> 00:25:23.000
window won't be accessible with the
other windows are maybe the file save

352 
00:25:23.396 --> 00:25:28.000
dialogue is broken so that this is the
thing is that a lot of these id's is not

353 
00:25:28.406 --> 00:25:31.000
so much that they're good or bad is a
whole ofthe times they're just weirdly

354 
00:25:31.406 --> 00:25:36.000
inconsistent, so certain interfaces will
be broken for a release or two makes it

355 
00:25:36.406 --> 00:25:40.000
kind of hard, especially if you're
lerner, but for professionals to yeah

356 
00:25:40.356 --> 00:25:45.000
could measure inconsistency is bad for
any demographic? Yeah, pretty much and i

357 
00:25:45.596 --> 00:25:49.000
think it's easy for a deaf to
accidentally screwed up because they

358 
00:25:49.466 --> 00:25:53.000
don't do it every like there. I think a
lot of designers they don't usually test

359 
00:25:53.586 --> 00:25:56.000
with the screen reader, and so they
don't really notice when something is

360 
00:25:56.626 --> 00:26:00.000
broken for the blind. Yeah, going to
that point, what are things we could do

361 
00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:06.000
if we are in the field off making id's
or mention any plug ins? One thing we

362 
00:26:06.886 --> 00:26:10.000
could do is tested with a scream.
Rainier do you have other concrete tips?

363 
00:26:11.076 --> 00:26:15.000
Suppose we're in the business of
developing iii's are related to that or

364 
00:26:15.356 --> 00:26:19.000
for programmers, what do we need to
check so there's a few things? Number

365 
00:26:19.506 --> 00:26:22.000
one is if you're at a big company and
you have the cash, you can get a

366 
00:26:22.856 --> 00:26:26.000
consultant to help because it is tricky
and so don't assume that like you have

367 
00:26:26.701 --> 00:26:30.000
to figure it all out yourself there's
lots of people out there that know how

368 
00:26:30.691 --> 00:26:35.000
to do it and that can help with it,
especially on the web. The web is not

369 
00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:39.000
perfect nowadays but it's so much better
today than it was, you know, twenty

370 
00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:46.000
years ago whatever and so that's number
one number two even though definitely

371 
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:51.000
turning on a screen reader is a good
thing and can help figure stuff out the

372 
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:55.000
the one tricky thing to do is to check
it compared to a variety of disability.

373 
00:26:55.831 --> 00:26:59.000
So think that one thing just kind of go
through a checklist of what those could

374 
00:26:59.301 --> 00:27:04.000
be. So for example, if you are totally
blind, you might use a screen reader but

375 
00:27:04.191 --> 00:27:08.000
ifyou're visually impaired, which is a
lie a lot more people than you might

376 
00:27:08.721 --> 00:27:12.000
think of issues like color contrast and
those air on light there's only checkers

377 
00:27:12.301 --> 00:27:16.000
for that and it's really easy to do and
even if you're not blind that's helpful

378 
00:27:16.851 --> 00:27:20.000
there too because like the color
contrast helps people read your page,

379 
00:27:20.591 --> 00:27:23.000
people could be colorblind, they benefit
they could also be colorblind, but they

380 
00:27:23.871 --> 00:27:27.000
could also just like it makes it easier
to read like, for example, you know if

381 
00:27:27.311 --> 00:27:30.000
you have black text on white background
that's really easy to read but black

382 
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:35.000
text on dark gray background maybe not
so much and so a lot of the issues that

383 
00:27:35.081 --> 00:27:38.000
you do with accessibility they tend to
have these other little benefits like

384 
00:27:38.891 --> 00:27:44.000
your sight is generally easier reading
so so that our top tips get consultant's

385 
00:27:44.261 --> 00:27:50.000
help if you can pay for it or use your
own at or website or idee with a screen

386 
00:27:50.951 --> 00:27:54.000
radio and we'll just see how it feels
screen reader enabled but also don't

387 
00:27:54.571 --> 00:27:57.000
forget that the visually impaired
community is larger than the totally

388 
00:27:57.931 --> 00:28:03.000
blind community so think about things
like magnification color contrasts and

389 
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:06.000
stuff like that you know we haven't
really talked about the braille

390 
00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:10.000
interface and lords oh yeah actually it
sounds weird but actually a lot of the

391 
00:28:10.881 --> 00:28:15.000
blind community doesn't actually know
braille that is present yeah it's sort

392 
00:28:15.161 --> 00:28:19.000
of a bizarre quirks but think about it
like this if you're blind and you go

393 
00:28:19.261 --> 00:28:22.000
blind later in life, the question is do
i just turn on a screen reader which i

394 
00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:27.000
can download at no cost or die by rail
to speed for like three to ten thousand

395 
00:28:27.111 --> 00:28:32.000
dollars and have to learn braille right?
So it's kind of a barrier however, if

396 
00:28:32.775 --> 00:28:36.000
you're at if you're a young person and
you know blind from birth or or very

397 
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:41.000
young oftentimes it's a good idea to
learn braille skills because it's a nice

398 
00:28:41.345 --> 00:28:46.000
way to read i'm so far as i understand
it but for us as developers the bro

399 
00:28:46.195 --> 00:28:50.000
interface is not as big of a chunk of
the people we could reach as is

400 
00:28:50.255 --> 00:28:53.000
optimized more scream read that's true
and if it if your interface is

401 
00:28:53.675 --> 00:28:58.000
accessible you most of the time get the
railing sign for free now there is some

402 
00:28:58.285 --> 00:29:02.000
tricky stuff like for example, braille
standards change over time and computer

403 
00:29:02.995 --> 00:29:07.000
symbols in braille like that using
programming language languages don't

404 
00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:11.000
always come out well, so there's really
getting really i'm not exactly sure

405 
00:29:11.215 --> 00:29:15.000
which ones i have a friend that's a
braille expert and i'm that's not it

406 
00:29:15.075 --> 00:29:18.000
sounds like you would know about all
these things, but a lot of these really

407 
00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:22.000
complicated and braille is one of those
areas i know less about, but yet little

408 
00:29:22.615 --> 00:29:25.000
weird symbols that we often use in
programming languages for whatever

409 
00:29:25.435 --> 00:29:31.000
reason, so so far we talked about tools,
abs websites and e what thing that's

410 
00:29:31.485 --> 00:29:34.000
really important to developers that we
haven't covered is the comm outline?

411 
00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:38.000
Does this create a way to work on the
command line? What does it read? Is that

412 
00:29:39.455 --> 00:29:43.000
better interface for people that are
visually impaired than running it from a

413 
00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:47.000
nineteen you for example, i say i
wouldn't say it's better, but it's

414 
00:29:47.235 --> 00:29:51.000
definitely most of the time they're
accessible, so a command line interface

415 
00:29:51.755 --> 00:29:56.000
is definitely a nice fall back, but when
you think about it oftentimes when your

416 
00:29:56.315 --> 00:30:00.000
programming a command line interface is
okay, but id's offing all sorts of stuff

417 
00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:04.000
like auto factoring and all that all
that so sometimes it is nice to be able

418 
00:30:04.835 --> 00:30:09.000
to use an i d which is why, you know,
people think prefer it however a command

419 
00:30:09.325 --> 00:30:12.000
line interface is almost always
accessible, which is why it's not a bad

420 
00:30:12.365 --> 00:30:15.000
option if you have to. Okay, so it's a
good idea to have come out into freight

421 
00:30:15.825 --> 00:30:19.000
kamala and phrase because it sort of
assessment by default yeah, you're

422 
00:30:19.005 --> 00:30:23.000
probably gonna have accessibility
support if you use one, you know? So you

423 
00:30:23.015 --> 00:30:27.000
briefly touched the bone re factoring
support as one of the things that an i d

424 
00:30:27.365 --> 00:30:33.000
offers us sighted people are those
features that blind people can use

425 
00:30:33.104 --> 00:30:37.000
because if i think of you factoring i e
i think of many things that are visual

426 
00:30:37.834 --> 00:30:42.000
let's say the rename refractory i think
of selecting a variable i think of right

427 
00:30:42.694 --> 00:30:47.000
clicking, getting a context menu,
selecting renamed rue factoring, getting

428 
00:30:47.034 --> 00:30:52.000
a bull pup that says what's the new name
getting a preview of how my source code

429 
00:30:52.194 --> 00:30:56.000
would look like in a new version is like
visual, visual, visual visual yeah, it

430 
00:30:56.814 --> 00:31:00.000
sounds like it wouldn't be, but they
usually are yeah, and then we have to be

431 
00:31:00.564 --> 00:31:04.000
but they usually are yeah, and the
reason is because they no, most of the

432 
00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:07.000
time, they use normal, gooey elements
like context, menus and stuff like

433 
00:31:07.004 --> 00:31:11.000
you're saying, and most of the time, if
you program it correctly and, like java,

434 
00:31:11.284 --> 00:31:16.000
isn't broken for accessibility, then yes,
they're accessible. But i should say,

435 
00:31:16.044 --> 00:31:19.000
i'm not trying to pick on java is just
happens to be not accessible if that's

436 
00:31:19.574 --> 00:31:25.000
the way it is, the weakness. I was also
thinking about testing, which also is

437 
00:31:25.484 --> 00:31:30.000
often inherently visual in the sense
that failing tests would get mad, i

438 
00:31:30.344 --> 00:31:35.000
thought, yeah, yeah, just do scream
readers read those thoughts. I'm not

439 
00:31:35.834 --> 00:31:40.000
sure about the specific interface for,
like j unit or something, but generally

440 
00:31:40.884 --> 00:31:44.000
speaking, those things can be coded to
be accessible. And also you can just

441 
00:31:44.154 --> 00:31:47.000
dump it to the command line and then
it'll be accessible. Teo far enough. And

442 
00:31:47.534 --> 00:31:54.000
what about quigley's? Okay, that's
tricky. So there's are a few things in

443 
00:31:55.184 --> 00:32:00.000
interfaces that are highly visual aren't
super accessible, so little squid lee's

444 
00:32:00.574 --> 00:32:04.000
actually are, believe it or not, or at
least you could make them and there's a

445 
00:32:04.294 --> 00:32:08.000
couple ways you can do it. One is what
we do in some of our tools with wind.

446 
00:32:08.794 --> 00:32:12.000
When you have a squiggly at the very,
very like point, one seconds will go

447 
00:32:12.794 --> 00:32:17.000
like something like that so that way the
thing is is that you need it to be right

448 
00:32:17.124 --> 00:32:19.000
at the beginning of the lancastrian
eyebrows you'll be like going up and

449 
00:32:19.794 --> 00:32:24.000
down between variables like this line
this line and then you can hear right

450 
00:32:24.324 --> 00:32:27.000
away that there's an error on the line.
So then in that case you might you can

451 
00:32:27.774 --> 00:32:31.000
either query for the air you can check
your compile bach or you can wait to the

452 
00:32:31.308 --> 00:32:35.000
end of the line and we embedded at the
end of the line so then it would be

453 
00:32:35.178 --> 00:32:39.000
different from how signing people would
perceive it because for us the squiggly

454 
00:32:39.238 --> 00:32:43.000
sometimes is not in there the entire
line but in a in the departure of the

455 
00:32:43.868 --> 00:32:47.000
line that is the issue. Oh, yeah,
clarity will be slightly different

456 
00:32:47.128 --> 00:32:51.000
because you get the error at the
beginning of the line so it's a bit less,

457 
00:32:51.788 --> 00:32:56.000
i think that's right information. Yeah,
but that's ok, cool. So all these things

458 
00:32:56.518 --> 00:33:01.000
that we perceive as visual are
understandable for blind users. Really?

459 
00:33:01.958 --> 00:33:06.000
Sometimes i mean, there are tricky ones.
I was just thinking of one s o if you

460 
00:33:06.228 --> 00:33:10.000
ever used one of those like interfaces
for gifts that are highly visual def so

461 
00:33:10.318 --> 00:33:14.000
yeah, you get like red is just lines and
green is the same lines compared to the

462 
00:33:14.868 --> 00:33:17.000
previous committed or to moscow yeah, it
would be awesome if those were

463 
00:33:17.938 --> 00:33:22.000
accessible but i'm not totally sure how
to do it because they're really, really

464 
00:33:22.498 --> 00:33:26.000
visual and they often use non standard
components so like custom little drawing

465 
00:33:26.618 --> 00:33:30.000
tools and things like that so i think
it's probably possible i've just uh

466 
00:33:30.448 --> 00:33:34.000
never trying you in theory you could
have something similar where you have

467 
00:33:34.118 --> 00:33:38.000
the cliques at the beginning of the line
for what is red and green for one that's

468 
00:33:38.178 --> 00:33:41.000
the same yeah and blind people
definitely can and do use version

469 
00:33:41.558 --> 00:33:45.000
control so for example i know we used to
have a number of blind children doing

470 
00:33:45.268 --> 00:33:49.000
lego robot competitions and so they
would use i fire akane correctly they'd

471 
00:33:49.368 --> 00:33:52.000
use get to send files back and forth to
each other because the command lines

472 
00:33:53.128 --> 00:33:57.000
accessible and we make it accessible in
some of our little ideas to you just we

473 
00:33:57.158 --> 00:34:01.000
just could never get like visual defying
working thing is a hard problem in

474 
00:34:01.158 --> 00:34:04.000
general even for people that can see it
kind of is and even if you get it on the

475 
00:34:04.488 --> 00:34:08.000
command line all those weird little get
symbols yeah, those air unreadable by

476 
00:34:08.058 --> 00:34:12.000
anybody yeah they're waiting for me in
me too i want to talk a little bit more

477 
00:34:12.967 --> 00:34:17.000
about the process of development so
suppose you were a blind or visually

478 
00:34:17.297 --> 00:34:20.000
impaired developer inside the company
and you want to communicate architecture

479 
00:34:21.277 --> 00:34:25.000
how would you use your mel diagram
generally speaking, you ml is not

480 
00:34:25.558 --> 00:34:30.000
accessible at all on dh when i say that
what i mean is that oftentimes you emma

481 
00:34:30.848 --> 00:34:34.000
was rendered in some way so you could do
it if you either had a graphical render

482 
00:34:34.938 --> 00:34:40.000
some other approach however oftentimes
all you, um it'll really does is provide

483 
00:34:40.728 --> 00:34:44.000
you a sense of the structure and there's
lots of ways to navigate structure. So

484 
00:34:44.618 --> 00:34:48.000
in other words, if you're out of design
meeting and you put uml up on the board

485 
00:34:48.228 --> 00:34:52.000
yeah that's not gonna help but if you
have like a development tool where you

486 
00:34:52.128 --> 00:34:55.000
can navigate the classes and read the
code, then that's the way that you could

487 
00:34:55.328 --> 00:34:58.000
be inclusive of a person that's blind
even if the rest of the team is using

488 
00:34:58.598 --> 00:35:03.000
uml at the same time. So as long as it's
a textural and structural representation

489 
00:35:03.718 --> 00:35:07.000
you can represent class iran's but the
visual version would be very tricky

490 
00:35:07.978 --> 00:35:11.000
pretty much now there was a really cool
dissertation done on a few years back. I

491 
00:35:11.628 --> 00:35:17.000
think the guy's name was alistair king
and his great work but i don't think

492 
00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:21.000
that there's really a lot that's
happened to make it accessible besides

493 
00:35:21.458 --> 00:35:26.000
one person's serious, dedicated effort
yeah, so that's something if we develop

494 
00:35:26.148 --> 00:35:29.000
there the fella person we want to be
inclusive of people back and see your

495 
00:35:29.558 --> 00:35:34.000
can see well we just shoot a news
diagrams we should keep to structural

496 
00:35:34.348 --> 00:35:38.000
information that is in the code base
rather than auxiliary document yeah, i

497 
00:35:38.268 --> 00:35:40.000
mean and you know how this stuff is
anyway it kind of gets out of date and

498 
00:35:40.868 --> 00:35:44.000
whether yeah, yeah, i'm sure there are
also a few dissertations that say, well,

499 
00:35:44.678 --> 00:35:48.000
the jumiller grams they got outdated
super quickly, right? Or have you read

500 
00:35:48.518 --> 00:35:52.000
that wonderful paper by marion petrie?
You know which one i'm talking about? No,

501 
00:35:52.828 --> 00:35:56.000
i don't think i do what's the thing that
i think it's called you a melon practice

502 
00:35:57.108 --> 00:36:01.000
she basically asked the question of do
people actually use uml? And the answer

503 
00:36:01.448 --> 00:36:07.000
was pretty much not much yeah, so i mean
macy paper thinking he was an ex way

504 
00:36:07.768 --> 00:36:11.000
linked to that is shown in its look very
related to distort it but it's a great

505 
00:36:11.278 --> 00:36:17.000
paper, ok, so far we've talked about it
sensibility in tools, websites and for

506 
00:36:17.118 --> 00:36:21.000
programming environment, so talk a
little bit about your work because you

507 
00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:26.000
have developed a programming system that
is inclusive off blind and visually

508 
00:36:26.018 --> 00:36:32.000
impaired children it's only more so one
of the observations that we made right

509 
00:36:32.448 --> 00:36:37.000
away was that although you could do some
work to make some of the tools or ideas

510 
00:36:37.188 --> 00:36:40.000
or development environments accessible,
some of the barriers that we saw

511 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.000
students still having we're with the
languages themselves and at the time we

512 
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:49.000
made this sort of really innocent had
this sort of really innocent question,

513 
00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:55.000
which was why two languages have that
design anyway and what was the evidence

514 
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:59.000
for that decision? So for example, if
you have a for loop in a language it's

515 
00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:04.000
entirely reasonable that that might be
the case but why did they use the word

516 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:09.000
for and what was the evidence for that
choice? Because it wasn't just one

517 
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.000
person that that impacted right like
languages were used by millions of

518 
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.000
people all over the world, so we might
expect that you could just

519 
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:20.000
hypothetically go to the programming
language designed literature, look it up

520 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.000
and figure out why they made certain
decisions and you're also thinking about

521 
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:28.000
that case where you say a four loop is
pronounced as for over brackett, i've

522 
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:34.000
rested russian very known you're a bull
or old double if you have to read it by

523 
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:38.000
screaming, yeah, exactly so it wasn't so
much that we thought for is bad or some

524 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.000
other word choices it's just that we
were sitting there watching children

525 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.000
like you know they're fourteen they
barely know how to use the computer

526 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.000
they're just learning programming for
the first time and they're like four

527 
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.000
left perrin into i and they're like, i
have no idea what this is trying to tell

528 
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.000
me and i just made it obvious me like i
wonder what other words you could use

529 
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.000
maybe we can look it up but when we
looked up information the literature

530 
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.000
there wasn't any evidence of these
things so we decided let's get some

531 
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.000
ourself so we started running like
surveys and we started writing him at at

532 
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:14.000
larger scale we started running
statistical experiments comparing

533 
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.000
competing design choices for syntax and
i mean i'm sure it's not that surprising

534 
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.000
but a lot of times you can make stuff
both orderly more understandable and

535 
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.000
more readable by using common sense
terminology and getting rid of certain

536 
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.000
kinds of tokens that you use the
scientific method to derive so for

537 
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.000
example a lupin quorum is repeat ten
times so that the parameter in a sense

538 
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:41.000
that then is in the middle of keywords
right which might be slightly unexpected

539 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:46.000
for people that i used to auto correct
but there's also other options i think

540 
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:50.000
there's repeat while and that works just
like a while but the key though is that

541 
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.000
you need that were repeat because that's
a hint toe a novice that that's what

542 
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:58.000
that does semantically so for example
the word repeat implies the concept of

543 
00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.000
federation so when you look at the
statistics for how novices use those

544 
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.000
tools if that words missing it's a
problem so one of the changes i

545 
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.000
understand it correctly that you made
your programming languages quorum is the

546 
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:17.000
synth tax has to be such that words
signifying meaning rather than being

547 
00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:23.000
weird words like four right and also a
lot of the punctuation has to be vetted.

548 
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.000
And the funny thing with those
punctuation results is that something

549 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:30.000
that sometimes they're kind of odd so
like, for example, uh, this one surprise

550 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:34.000
me if you look at if statements and you
pull out the statistics for if

551 
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:40.000
statements java or many languages use
parentheses on the sides and it turns

552 
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:46.000
out those are likely to get screwed up,
however you you also get need to get rid

553 
00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.000
of the left brace, but not the right one,
which is sort of a bizarre decision. So

554 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.000
in corum you haven't if and then you
have an expression and then the word end

555 
00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:58.000
so and it sounds sort of bizarre, but if
you leave that left one in, it turns out

556 
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.000
that the statistical probability of
novices getting that one correct are

557 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:06.000
pretty low, so you pull it out and
everything's fine. So instead of if open

558 
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.000
brackets something something close
bracket you have if and then the

559 
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:15.000
conditions and then end, right, and then
the other weird decision, but it turns

560 
00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:20.000
out to be pretty impactful is a few test
you have this question of, should i use

561 
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.000
the double equal sign or a single equals
or triple equals or something like that?

562 
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.000
And it turns out that answer is has a
surprisingly large effect size, so, for

563 
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:34.000
example if i use a programming language
like java, perl, stuff like that and i

564 
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:38.000
compare, use a double equal sign if i
use a single equal, even if i use the

565 
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.000
same symbol for assignment increases the
probability of getting that token

566 
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:47.000
correct by eightfold so it's way better
to have let me summarize that an equal

567 
00:40:47.066 --> 00:40:52.000
sign for assignments, and also for
comparison, oddly enough, we've we have

568 
00:40:52.926 --> 00:40:56.000
designed test cases where we used them
both right next to each other, to try to

569 
00:40:56.436 --> 00:41:00.000
trick offices up, because the way we're
thinking, if we're gonna overload it,

570 
00:41:00.136 --> 00:41:04.000
that's got a fella p up, turns out not,
and is this just for blankets or for all

571 
00:41:04.946 --> 00:41:08.000
the cans, everybody, it used to be in
corum that, like we were, we just

572 
00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:11.000
started with blind children, but now i
think it's something like thirty six

573 
00:41:11.556 --> 00:41:16.000
thousand kids a year ballpark, so a lot
more than we would have expected, so so

574 
00:41:16.766 --> 00:41:20.000
that road considerations fur sin, thanks
how to make syntax more inclusive, so

575 
00:41:20.966 --> 00:41:25.000
that if you read it, it is easier to
read, but also for other kids is more

576 
00:41:25.786 --> 00:41:30.000
inclusive. Does your programming
environment also have? Are you like

577 
00:41:30.646 --> 00:41:34.000
features to specifically support
blankets that other ideas your

578 
00:41:34.406 --> 00:41:39.000
programming tools don't have? Yes, so
we've change the various features that

579 
00:41:39.636 --> 00:41:43.000
we have for the blind overtime so but
some of them include additional

580 
00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:47.000
navigation features that we build into
navigators and stuff like that we have a

581 
00:41:47.716 --> 00:41:53.000
self voicing option so sort of funny
because screenwriters sometimes break on

582 
00:41:53.336 --> 00:41:58.000
certain platforms which is stinky but
reality one of the things that we allow

583 
00:41:58.376 --> 00:42:03.000
people to do in our ideas basically turn
off the default accessibility support

584 
00:42:03.066 --> 00:42:07.000
turn on just a different speech engine
which people don't like a cz much

585 
00:42:07.296 --> 00:42:11.000
however it works everywhere and it's
virtually guaranteed toe actually talk

586 
00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:15.000
and that speech engine is inside of your
programming platform pretty much yeah

587 
00:42:16.016 --> 00:42:20.000
and it's not you know so this is a thing
oftentimes with accessibility if you get

588 
00:42:20.136 --> 00:42:24.000
to eighty percent and it actually works
it's enough so in our case even though

589 
00:42:24.336 --> 00:42:27.000
the tools that we had weren't really
perfect at the same time was enough to

590 
00:42:27.656 --> 00:42:31.000
bring the number of schools for the
blind in united states that were

591 
00:42:31.526 --> 00:42:35.000
teaching programming from basically zero
toe about half wow, that is impressive.

592 
00:42:36.826 --> 00:42:40.000
So what are some features that you
consider to put into coram but didn't

593 
00:42:40.826 --> 00:42:45.000
make the cut and for what reasons in
terms of like language features or heidi

594 
00:42:45.634 --> 00:42:50.000
features or things that maybe if we're
programming we think oh, this is a good

595 
00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:54.000
idea and you tried it and it didn't work
we want to hear about those okay sure so

596 
00:42:54.934 --> 00:42:59.000
if you we do a lot of experiments
because normally form, we call it

597 
00:42:59.284 --> 00:43:03.000
evidence based on all that really means
is that before we change the syntax and

598 
00:43:03.024 --> 00:43:06.000
semantics to the language and force
every developer using it for every kid

599 
00:43:06.354 --> 00:43:11.000
using it to relearn it, we like we run a
test and the test is usually put people

600 
00:43:11.694 --> 00:43:15.000
in a room have two people tried or fifty
people tried one hundred people try it

601 
00:43:15.214 --> 00:43:18.000
and see what happens. If it turns out
people do pretty well, then it can go in

602 
00:43:18.824 --> 00:43:22.000
the language, and if it turns out people
don't do very well, then we kind of let

603 
00:43:22.674 --> 00:43:26.000
it fall by the wayside, so we tried a
bunch of these the one that's, the most

604 
00:43:26.684 --> 00:43:30.000
common that has made it that is both in
cornerman has the strongest evidentiary

605 
00:43:30.894 --> 00:43:34.000
support for it is static type icc sounds
like a silly thing it's, not like form,

606 
00:43:34.814 --> 00:43:39.000
is the only language that has it, but
the evidence is extremely clear that

607 
00:43:39.504 --> 00:43:42.000
static typing makes developers more
productive. If you're using a

608 
00:43:42.444 --> 00:43:47.000
dynamically language, what happens is,
as you go to call a function, oftentimes

609 
00:43:47.394 --> 00:43:50.000
developers don't know what to pass to
the function, so they go hunting for it,

610 
00:43:50.994 --> 00:43:54.000
and it turns out in experiments that
amount of time where they're off hunting

611 
00:43:54.804 --> 00:43:58.000
for what to pass to a dynamically type
function. Matches the time differences

612 
00:43:58.574 --> 00:44:02.000
in the studies which means basically
observation aly we have evidence that

613 
00:44:02.644 --> 00:44:07.000
dynamic typing makes perf programmers
slower than static typing this and this

614 
00:44:07.794 --> 00:44:11.000
is for sided developers but i can
imagine the effect might be even bigger

615 
00:44:11.944 --> 00:44:16.000
for blind developers because navigation
is such a babe big issue because for us

616 
00:44:16.774 --> 00:44:21.000
just scrolling to function is just that
just screwing but if you're a blanket or

617 
00:44:21.154 --> 00:44:26.000
blind professional developer the
navigation is is so big of a hurdle it's

618 
00:44:26.364 --> 00:44:30.000
even worse i can imagine i've actually
never tested it with professional blind

619 
00:44:30.504 --> 00:44:34.000
developers but i would be very surprised
if you were wrong i think you're right

620 
00:44:34.604 --> 00:44:40.000
so this is a nice example off something
that is useful for everyone no just

621 
00:44:40.654 --> 00:44:45.000
making it inclusive for like developers
but it's better for everyone so against

622 
00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:49.000
the language yeah i think so i think it
goes both ways there's there's one other

623 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:53.000
that maybe maybe your listeners will be
interested so the c plus plus standard a

624 
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.000
few years back added lambda is to the
specifications and we were curious

625 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:02.000
whether or not that had a positive or
negative impact so we ran an empirical

626 
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:07.000
study in just comparing c plus plus
lando's to it aerators which is not the

627 
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.000
only test you would need to make a
determination but its starting point oh

628 
00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.000
it was also what apparently the spect
writers in the original white paper

629 
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:20.000
claimed it was for two hundred plays its
traitors apparently so way ran a test

630 
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:26.000
and we compared freshman in college
sophomores, juniors, seniors and then

631 
00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:30.000
professional developers that we
recruited from experts in lamb jas and

632 
00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:34.000
we found that the experts had no benefit
at all and it basically crushed all of

633 
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:38.000
the novices so it's one of these weird
features where you know developers put

634 
00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.000
something in the language and maybe it
has a benefit but we found no evidence

635 
00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:48.000
to that this is interesting because
people say, oh, i like it because it has

636 
00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:53.000
land us i mean i would say that i shall
it so nice is that but you're saying if

637 
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:59.000
we measure if it helps it doesn't help
professionals and it herds kid's a

638 
00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:03.000
novice is under the conditions of the
test that we ran yes and i don't think

639 
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
that land is versus it aerators is sort
of the end of the story however we did

640 
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.000
sort of just take it from what the
developers said so it's a starting point

641 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:14.000
but it's possible there's other weird
situations where it might help like

642 
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.000
event driven programming your database
or something but those need to be

643 
00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.000
verified through the scientific method
to see if that's actually true and i

644 
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.000
think you also mentioned before not in
the show but when we were training

645 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:29.000
before that land does are specifically
hard to be pronounced by screen reader

646 
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:34.000
because the order is so different from
an incinerator oh, i don't remember

647 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:37.000
saying that, but actually, that does
make sense, it's very plausible and

648 
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:41.000
there's sort of a weird, wacky syntax
and has a wacky scene. Yeah, and

649 
00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.000
sometimes with that wacky syntax,
believe or not, this especially hard for

650 
00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.000
blind children, screeners don't always
read literally, so they skipped

651 
00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:53.000
characters. What do they skip? It seems
horrible, all sorts of stuff, and when

652 
00:46:53.315 --> 00:46:56.000
you think about it, that makes sense for,
like microsoft word, because you don't

653 
00:46:56.885 --> 00:47:00.000
want a reading every period that would
drive you insane. So basically, what

654 
00:47:00.975 --> 00:47:03.000
some blind farmers do is they turn on
these verbosity modes to make sure they

655 
00:47:03.875 --> 00:47:07.000
hear everything, but if you're blind and
you're just starting out, you don't even

656 
00:47:07.435 --> 00:47:11.000
know these things exist likely, and if
you have to turn on reading every

657 
00:47:11.075 --> 00:47:14.000
character that it gets back to annoying
again. So it's sort of like this

658 
00:47:14.855 --> 00:47:19.000
unfortunate sort of weird middle ground
with syntax where it's like you could do

659 
00:47:19.675 --> 00:47:23.000
it, but it gets in the way. Yeah,
because some programming that was have

660 
00:47:23.395 --> 00:47:27.000
adults for list access, and that would
be annoying if you would be skips. I

661 
00:47:27.775 --> 00:47:32.000
think so. Do you also take that into
account in this insects of cora? So you

662 
00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:35.000
you were like, oh, lesson old used old
speakers scream readers could but don't

663 
00:47:35.865 --> 00:47:42.000
skip oh calm actually no because we
control the speech pipeline separately

664 
00:47:42.515 --> 00:47:45.000
were very judicious about what
characters the screenwriter says because

665 
00:47:45.375 --> 00:47:49.000
we control it yeah, but i think you
mentioned before that sometimes they use

666 
00:47:49.865 --> 00:47:53.000
quorum with their bill in screen reader
and then maybe yeah, we cheat there too

667 
00:47:53.995 --> 00:47:59.000
okay? Cheat yeah, you overwrite it
basically although we don't actually use

668 
00:47:59.155 --> 00:48:02.000
dots to sort of one of the weird quirky
things about form syntax that came from

669 
00:48:02.745 --> 00:48:09.000
data but my only annoys me we found
evidence that the dot operator isn't the

670 
00:48:09.805 --> 00:48:14.000
operator you should use for objects for
whatever reason surveys on it at scale

671 
00:48:14.775 --> 00:48:19.000
show the colon operator makes more sense
to human beings sort of drove me crazy

672 
00:48:19.495 --> 00:48:22.000
enough that i ran a replication study at
a different university in a different

673 
00:48:22.895 --> 00:48:26.000
part of the country just to try to prove
it wrong, but unfortunately it

674 
00:48:26.295 --> 00:48:30.000
replicated with tremendous precision. So
you're saying we shouldn't use dole's

675 
00:48:30.355 --> 00:48:36.000
for object access oddly, which everyone
does yes almost it's annoying but one's

676 
00:48:36.415 --> 00:48:40.000
aaron very good no, i've never seen it.
In fact, we kind of put it in there is a

677 
00:48:40.255 --> 00:48:43.000
junk character we didn't think would win
the study, but you know, i don't get to

678 
00:48:43.535 --> 00:48:49.000
choose these things that's interesting
sort of bizarre i'm not even exactly i

679 
00:48:49.217 --> 00:48:52.000
have a guess, but i'm not entirely sure
i even observe that result like for

680 
00:48:52.637 --> 00:48:57.000
example, maybe dot just implies like the
end of a sentence or something or maybe

681 
00:48:57.347 --> 00:49:02.000
colin implies some kind of connected
listers i'm not really sure but you know

682 
00:49:02.187 --> 00:49:05.000
we did it we got the answer we
replicated it got the same answer me

683 
00:49:05.307 --> 00:49:09.000
whales do you d'oh interesting okay, but
the fact that the readers read a

684 
00:49:09.707 --> 00:49:13.000
character or or don't read character
isn't what influence the syntax

685 
00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:17.000
everything you put into forum is there
because you tried it with people and you

686 
00:49:17.617 --> 00:49:21.000
measured a result not for everything.
When we first started the project, we

687 
00:49:21.457 --> 00:49:25.000
were just working with kids and so think
about it like this the very first

688 
00:49:25.477 --> 00:49:28.000
version of corn we made a bunch of
decisions and not all of them were

689 
00:49:28.747 --> 00:49:32.000
evidence based because that didn't exist
it wasn't beginning exactly and there

690 
00:49:32.807 --> 00:49:35.000
was no such thing as an evidence
oriented language that that did not

691 
00:49:35.867 --> 00:49:40.000
exist, so but we found we figured out
really quickly that we needed some

692 
00:49:40.167 --> 00:49:44.000
evidence tto make it better. So then
what we did is every time we made a

693 
00:49:44.037 --> 00:49:48.000
change to the language, we started
adjusting it over time, but there are a

694 
00:49:48.087 --> 00:49:51.000
few decisions and corum that air left
that we haven't run a study on yet that

695 
00:49:51.587 --> 00:49:55.000
i think probably get invalidated hope
one of them is we have this sort of

696 
00:49:55.587 --> 00:49:59.000
wacky multiple inheritance system it's
not like c plus plus is it's sort of

697 
00:49:59.667 --> 00:50:04.000
it's this own thing but it would not
surprise me if some day we get a study

698 
00:50:04.057 --> 00:50:07.000
together that it could be invalidated
but we try to do that that's sort of our

699 
00:50:07.667 --> 00:50:12.000
goal is to sow is to run tests to
invalidate our own choices to make them

700 
00:50:12.397 --> 00:50:19.000
better over time so an interesting
question there is ardor cool flits or

701 
00:50:19.187 --> 00:50:23.000
tension between the use for a
programming language for blind

702 
00:50:23.917 --> 00:50:29.000
professional developers to use for
learning blind in offices or cited in

703 
00:50:29.377 --> 00:50:36.000
offices or learning adult developers
mean you say we tested it on people

704 
00:50:37.217 --> 00:50:42.000
maybe some features are really great for
professional developers that shouldn't

705 
00:50:42.677 --> 00:50:45.000
be in the language foreign offices i
mean this is a little bit like that

706 
00:50:45.637 --> 00:50:49.000
example you gave land us for experts
they don't matter before kids they

707 
00:50:49.489 --> 00:50:55.000
really matter so are you arguing for one
language that's perfect for everyone or

708 
00:50:56.229 --> 00:51:00.000
to do taylor a language that
specifically for blind no emphasis and

709 
00:51:00.669 --> 00:51:04.000
another language that has land lies and
all the bells and whistles for

710 
00:51:04.129 --> 00:51:08.000
professionals what is best there? I
think that that's a great question and i

711 
00:51:08.139 --> 00:51:11.000
think that even the academic community
doesn't really know and there's a really

712 
00:51:11.909 --> 00:51:16.000
good reason it turns out that between
like the fifties until about two

713 
00:51:16.629 --> 00:51:21.000
thousand twelve if you take a reasonable
chunk of the academic literature in

714 
00:51:21.469 --> 00:51:24.000
computer science on programming
languages they didn't actually test with

715 
00:51:24.879 --> 00:51:29.000
people so we don't have a consensus, and
i say they didn't test, i mean, almost

716 
00:51:29.409 --> 00:51:35.000
overwhelmingly, universally did not test
specifically there's, a scholar by the

717 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:40.000
name of anti hani donahoe, and he
discovered that during that period on ly,

718 
00:51:40.819 --> 00:51:45.000
about twenty two controlled experiments
were conducted, and the thing is that's

719 
00:51:45.449 --> 00:51:50.000
just not enough for us to really know.
Now, to be more of a more direct answer,

720 
00:51:50.859 --> 00:51:53.000
we do have evidence, like you say,
though, that there are some features

721 
00:51:53.969 --> 00:51:57.000
that might be in conflict between
novices, um, professionals, one of them

722 
00:51:57.709 --> 00:52:01.000
is, again static typing. It turns out
most of the studies and replications

723 
00:52:01.689 --> 00:52:05.000
that we've done or somewhere in the
ballpark of, like yours, three of an

724 
00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:08.000
academic program up through, like
beginning professional, so we don't

725 
00:52:08.419 --> 00:52:11.000
really have much good information passed
that, and we don't have much good

726 
00:52:11.929 --> 00:52:15.000
information about, like children or
children with disabilities or children

727 
00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:19.000
with, you know, men, women, all these
different kinds of groups, and i think

728 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:23.000
if we really want to flesh out whether
or not we can make languages that find a

729 
00:52:23.499 --> 00:52:27.000
good middle ground for everybody, we're
going to be a heck of a lot more data

730 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:31.000
from but not just for me from like, on
entire academic community, otherwise we

731 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:35.000
probably won't get there. Yes so in
general would you say that not just for

732 
00:52:35.879 --> 00:52:40.000
our language let's zoom out a bit again
so tools aps websites and programming

733 
00:52:40.859 --> 00:52:45.000
environments should they have a specific
version for the visually impaired on a

734 
00:52:45.909 --> 00:52:50.000
special version for sighted people like
you have an english version in the

735 
00:52:50.059 --> 00:52:53.000
spanish version and you get the medicine
the same with all these programmers

736 
00:52:53.622 --> 00:52:57.000
should there be an office programming
experience and something val producers

737 
00:52:57.562 --> 00:53:00.000
or should it will be the same what is
your take on that specialize or

738 
00:53:00.982 --> 00:53:05.000
generalized my vote is for generalized
and you know i don't have a crystal ball

739 
00:53:05.012 --> 00:53:08.000
so i can't know for sure but here's my
reasoning when it comes to the first

740 
00:53:08.962 --> 00:53:13.000
question which is specialized for the
blind or not that one i would give a

741 
00:53:13.132 --> 00:53:17.000
hard no and the reason is because
sometimes when there's tools that are

742 
00:53:17.222 --> 00:53:20.000
developed just for the blind they don't
get maintained as well because you know

743 
00:53:20.882 --> 00:53:24.000
a company might make more money off the
one that's general purpose than not so

744 
00:53:24.922 --> 00:53:28.000
that's one reason why at least i don't
know how it is where you're from but in

745 
00:53:28.912 --> 00:53:32.000
the united states well that's one reason
why they make laws about making general

746 
00:53:32.032 --> 00:53:37.000
technology accessible because they don't
want like amazon to make like the blind

747 
00:53:37.072 --> 00:53:41.000
reader that they maintain once and then
don't support for fifty years yeah yeah

748 
00:53:41.712 --> 00:53:46.000
okay you but that is a practical
argument or maybe a capitalist arguments

749 
00:53:46.582 --> 00:53:52.000
it's not a philosophical argument about
what is past talk about no dural as it

750 
00:53:52.522 --> 00:53:57.000
is now, but the world i was we will i'd
like it to be do you think a specific

751 
00:53:57.012 --> 00:54:01.000
app for your website for visually
impaired that maybe mrs um features

752 
00:54:01.702 --> 00:54:06.000
that's? Why did developers would like is
that better journals suppose we have the

753 
00:54:06.402 --> 00:54:11.000
money to maintain when everyone okay,
that's a fair point? I i still think i

754 
00:54:11.212 --> 00:54:16.000
prefer the generalist, though, and the
reason is because a lot of the type of

755 
00:54:16.272 --> 00:54:20.000
stuff that i was taken i d that i d does
are things like buttons and lists and

756 
00:54:20.682 --> 00:54:24.000
trees and stuff, and those were actually
pretty accessible if it's there. So i do

757 
00:54:24.642 --> 00:54:28.000
think that you can make specialized
features in ieds that would be

758 
00:54:28.202 --> 00:54:32.000
accessible. That would be better, though,
so for example, i do suspect you'd want

759 
00:54:32.242 --> 00:54:35.000
to specialize the bugger because right
now most debugging technologies don't

760 
00:54:35.992 --> 00:54:40.000
talk and there are known i've invented
some talking to buggers over the years.

761 
00:54:40.222 --> 00:54:43.000
How cool yeah, they're they're pretty
fun, they like tell you like what

762 
00:54:43.302 --> 00:54:46.000
variables were doing and stuff like that
they're pretty neat the current version

763 
00:54:46.812 --> 00:54:49.000
that we have the attacking the buggers
not great, but i'm hoping to build some

764 
00:54:49.952 --> 00:54:54.000
new ones in the some new projects and so
i'm still curious about that talking the

765 
00:54:54.082 --> 00:54:58.000
bugger how does it work and why isn't
that great? But what are you going to

766 
00:54:58.266 --> 00:55:02.000
add that s oh it's a little bit harder
to build it on top of, like the j v m,

767 
00:55:02.106 --> 00:55:05.000
javascript and other languages, which is
what cornum compiles to a bunch of

768 
00:55:05.366 --> 00:55:09.000
different places. So during my
dissertation, working like the mid to

769 
00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:15.000
thousands or so which makes me feel old
now, okay, way had, like an interpreted

770 
00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:20.000
version of sea that were playing around
with and if you contract information

771 
00:55:20.646 --> 00:55:23.000
about the state of a program and a
little bit better way, you could make

772 
00:55:23.446 --> 00:55:26.000
the buggers say all sorts of cool stuff,
like saying what kind of methods are

773 
00:55:26.466 --> 00:55:30.000
being called as you navigate instead of,
like what line you're on, say, oh, hey,

774 
00:55:30.576 --> 00:55:34.000
the variable a was set to five, and so
you could give people context about

775 
00:55:34.606 --> 00:55:38.000
what's changing in a program. Of course,
the challenges are like, what context

776 
00:55:38.596 --> 00:55:44.000
you give? Yeah, so let's ask it probably
does so the stuff that we did was

777 
00:55:44.876 --> 00:55:47.000
relatively primitive. We would just kind
of tell you the most obvious thing like,

778 
00:55:47.966 --> 00:55:52.000
hey, this method was called or hey, this
variable changed, but nonetheless, even

779 
00:55:52.176 --> 00:55:56.000
with just those changes, the studies
that we ran were pretty obviously clear

780 
00:55:56.596 --> 00:56:00.000
that is better than saying you're online
five, you know which is kind of obvious

781 
00:56:00.216 --> 00:56:04.000
but nonetheless like simple little
things can sometimes make a big

782 
00:56:04.036 --> 00:56:07.000
difference for accessibility, but and
they're just not enquire meant this

783 
00:56:07.486 --> 00:56:10.000
point for technical reasons and all
because you don't believe they work well

784 
00:56:10.736 --> 00:56:14.000
the second the butter yes, they kind of
go in and out with every releases we

785 
00:56:14.086 --> 00:56:18.000
experiment so sometimes way are building
a new versions will pull something out

786 
00:56:18.746 --> 00:56:22.000
for a while and are the bugger right now
is okay, but it's nothing super special,

787 
00:56:22.906 --> 00:56:28.000
so i can imagine these type of features
like at the burger that talks aren't

788 
00:56:28.306 --> 00:56:33.000
just useful for visually impaired people
but also for sighted people. Can you

789 
00:56:33.686 --> 00:56:38.000
give a few examples off accessibility
features in general not just in ideas

790 
00:56:38.556 --> 00:56:43.000
but also an absolute websites that are
designed for visually impaired people

791 
00:56:43.306 --> 00:56:47.000
but also can be useful for sighted
people? I think i might have already

792 
00:56:47.516 --> 00:56:51.000
mentioned this one, but probably the
most obvious and easy to understand one

793 
00:56:51.416 --> 00:56:58.000
is color contrast moves yeah, yeah, yeah,
okay, so ah lot of the times the

794 
00:56:58.242 --> 00:57:03.000
features that people use with
accessibility can actually also be used

795 
00:57:03.062 --> 00:57:06.000
by people without disabilities and one
obvious one that that blind people use

796 
00:57:06.922 --> 00:57:10.000
heavily and so decided people is
keyboard shortcuts and think about it

797 
00:57:11.262 --> 00:57:13.000
some about some of the people that i've
known over the years that are blind

798 
00:57:13.592 --> 00:57:18.000
don't have a monitor or a mouse way
needed by what they needed exactly and

799 
00:57:18.812 --> 00:57:22.000
so, like you generally navigate like
crazy with the keyboard so if you're

800 
00:57:22.302 --> 00:57:26.000
writing an app and you make tons of
awesome keyboard shortcuts and waste a

801 
00:57:26.022 --> 00:57:29.000
knave a grant around of the keyboard and
you're an expert users you'll probably

802 
00:57:29.252 --> 00:57:33.000
like that anyway but blind people will
love you forever yes it's some features

803 
00:57:33.622 --> 00:57:37.000
you met me you might make that you might
even make them for expert usual sure

804 
00:57:37.172 --> 00:57:41.000
like yeah, all the shortcuts and then
they're useful for blind people but also

805 
00:57:41.532 --> 00:57:44.000
the other way right? Yeah exactly or
just make him for you because like you

806 
00:57:44.622 --> 00:57:48.000
might love those things and have them
extra and then blind are crazy about

807 
00:57:48.672 --> 00:57:53.000
keeper shirt yeah that's the thing right
including myself so i'm most curious in

808 
00:57:53.542 --> 00:57:57.000
the other way around are their
accessibility features that you can put

809 
00:57:57.362 --> 00:58:02.000
into a tool a rupture your app that
might hamper so your people that we

810 
00:58:02.962 --> 00:58:06.000
sighted people would be like ways that
there that is confusing me it's not

811 
00:58:06.792 --> 00:58:13.000
helpful? Is that a thing or is that not?
Um yeah, probably i mean the you know

812 
00:58:13.072 --> 00:58:16.000
it's really easy is a developer to make
a boo boo and make something hard to

813 
00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:20.000
understand so a lot of the same things
like you know if you're content is

814 
00:58:20.522 --> 00:58:26.000
written in a funny way or your interface
has weird color contrasts in it or the

815 
00:58:26.742 --> 00:58:33.000
buttons air aligned in strange ways or
ah good one might be tab order like for

816 
00:58:33.262 --> 00:58:36.000
a sighted person that's using the
keyboard shortcuts that they have weird

817 
00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:39.000
tab orders so that you're flying around
the interface in a funny way for a

818 
00:58:39.522 --> 00:58:43.000
sighted person that's going to be odd,
you know, like imagine like a form where

819 
00:58:43.452 --> 00:58:48.000
it jumps to the wrong spots as you press
tab right for you and i that because i'm

820 
00:58:48.512 --> 00:58:52.000
a sighted person too. That would be
really annoying for a blind person who

821 
00:58:52.072 --> 00:58:59.000
drive them bonkers. So so we can be xer
debated by no being able to see exactly

822 
00:58:59.482 --> 00:59:04.000
cool. Those are all things we can take
into going toe when making stuff for

823 
00:59:04.352 --> 00:59:08.000
blind people but also making it
accessible for other people. That was

824 
00:59:08.622 --> 00:59:11.000
everything i wanted to ask. Is there
anything you want to add anything we

825 
00:59:11.812 --> 00:59:17.000
missed? No, i think that you have a lot
of questions that i appreciate a whole

826 
00:59:17.522 --> 00:59:21.000
lot of made me actually think about it
who's gonna want to make our guests

827 
00:59:21.472 --> 00:59:25.000
thing to make her audience. I think we
just want to ask you one more thing if

828 
00:59:25.082 --> 00:59:28.000
that's okay, if we want to know more
about you, your programming language,

829 
00:59:28.862 --> 00:59:32.000
the cool stuff you're doing, what is
your website when we re more about you

830 
00:59:32.622 --> 00:59:37.000
well, i think in google, andrea steph iq
and my university website is up and i'll

831 
00:59:37.802 --> 00:59:41.000
send you a link, but if you want to read
more about forum, you go to korean

832 
00:59:41.762 --> 00:59:45.000
language dot com, you want to read more
about evidence, there's a nice little

833 
00:59:45.162 --> 00:59:48.000
link right on the fun, and it'll give
you a bunch of little details about how

834 
00:59:48.592 --> 00:59:51.000
this evidence thing kind of works cool.
We'll make sure all of those are in the

835 
00:59:51.872 --> 00:59:56.000
show showing a school. Thank you for
